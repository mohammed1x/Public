Publisher’s Note
Darussalam feels proud to present another book on the life of
the Prophet
He was the most outstanding person that the world
has seen. He was a religious guide, a social and moral reformer, a
political visionary, a military general, and an administrator who
founded a state, built a nation and established a dynamic society to
usher in a new philosophy of human thought, action and behavior.
Moreover, he accomplished all these in a short period of only
twenty-three years. There is no human in history who contributed to
humanity so much in such diverse fields, as did the Prophet i|.
Although there have been other Prophets in the past who
contributed their share to the world, but as they were sent to
particular nations or geographical regions, we find no traces of them
as regards details of their lives and teachings, the time and place of
their birth, and details about the exact impact they produced on the
human society. This is not the case with the Prophet #| We know
about his birth, childhood, the latter days until he got married, the
beginning of his mission, the difficulties he faced, his migration, his
success, have all been fully and accurately documented and
preserved for the rest of the time.
Today, after more than 1400 years, details of the life, manners,
actions and teachings of the Prophet
are available without any
loss, alteration or modification. They offer the same light for treating
the many ills of our times as in the past, but in fact acquire greater
importance in view of new dimensions to human suffering because
of the wrong policies of those countries that consider themselves
above the Law. The United Nations and other bodies that were set
up to secure the rights of the wronged are being manipulated to
oppress weaker nations, resulting in untold sufferings, and
desperate acts on the part of the victims.

m

The Prophet it had also made a body to secure the rights of the
oppressed, but it was not a window dressing. It was a grand success
for the honesty behind it. In the words of Prof. Hurgronje, The
League of Nations founded by Prophet of Islam put the principle of

The Prophet of Islam

12

international unity of human brotherhood on such universal
foundations as to show candle to other nations. The fact is that no
nation of the world can show a parallel to what Islam has done
towards the realization of the idea of the League of Nations."
George Bernard Shaw said, "If Muhammad were alive today, he
would succeed in solving all those problems which threaten to
destroy human civilization in our times."
Let us study the life of the Prophet #§ whose teachings and
examples can change our lives, our thinking, our behavior and the
whole world for the better. He is truly a Blessing for Mankind. May
Allah shower His blessings on him!

Translator’s Note
Historical personalities fade with time. But this is not true of the
Prophet of Islam, on whom be peace. Our own times are witnessing
a renewed interest in him, his character and his message. Written
both by Muslims as well as non-Muslims, books continue to appear
on him at a regular pace.
The work at hand is one of the most comprehensive ones of our
times. It stands out in a few ways. First, every detail has been traced
back to the original sources. Second, events of the Prophet's life have
been related to modem times and lessons drawn for the benefit of
those who happen to face similar situations in their struggle to
spread the Islamic faith. The author's complete objectivity could be
cited as another outstanding characteristic of the book. In contrast
with the Western method - of judging a personality they struggle to
come to terms with - Dr. Mahdi Rizqullah Ahmad meticulously
chronicles the life as preserved by the earliest authorities, and leaves
the reader to make his own judgment.
Except for the author's foreword, which has been considerably
reduced in size, and which introduces source books and authors, the
rest of the book has been translated in full. Subsequent to the
publication of the work in Arabic (called, As-Sirah An-Nabawiyyah, fi

Daw Al-Masadir Al-Asliyyah, Dirasah Tahliliyyah, Faisal Foundation,
Riyadh, 1992), the author has continued to work and has produced
some 56 pages of fresh material to be added to future publications.
These pages, still in manuscript form, have been incorporated in this
translation.
A word about the equivalents to the technical terms used by

Hadith scholars is perhaps in order. To allow for fluency, I have
substituted Arabic terms with words closest in English, not unaware
that sometimes they can be misleading. For example, to render a

Da'if Hadith as a 'weak report' is far from satisfactory. The term Da if
needs a lengthy definition. Not every Da if report is untrustworthy.

The Prophet of Islam

14

Moreover, the connotation carried by the term 'weak' is sometimes
not there in the original. This applies to several terms used in Hadith
criticism. But the difficulty in using original Arabic terms is that they
affect the flow. Therefore, terms such as 'Good' for Hasan reports,
'Disconnected'

for Mursal, 'Suspended'

or 'Discontinued'

for

Mu'allaq or Mawqufi 'Interrupted' for Munqati', etc., have had to be
employed. Where an easy rendering was not possible, the original
was used. The reader will have to look into a work on Hadith
Criticism to understand the exact implication of these various
Arabic terms.
The translator has tried to retain the author's style of writing,
but not at the cost of inaccuracy. The endeavor has been to give
minimum possible idiomatic turn to his phrases and sentences.
This translation was originally done at the request of World
Association of Muslim Youth, Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia
(WAMY), who got it read by the author himself, and then by two
other persons. Both the brothers preferred to remain anonymous,
but offered some very good suggestions and are responsible in no
small way for the improvements in the translation. In addition, the
first chapter was read through by another anonymous person who
also helped remove some defects. Finally, brother Ali Haider of
Darussalam did the painstaking job of correcting, formatting and
indexing work of the book. May Allah reward them all generously.
Brother Abdul-Malik Mujahid of Darussalam needs special
mention for his personal interest and earnestness, which went above
business considerations, without which this book would not have
appeared in the present form. May Allah reward him amply; He is
the best of those who reward.

Preface

It has not been my endeavor to merely gather together under
one title all the narratives that have come down to us concerning
Prophet Muhammad #§, but rather to present those that are fairly
reliable for their authenticity. Reports not so reliable have only been
used in matters not pertaining to the creed or law. The large number
of footnotes was therefore necessary. They demonstrate that if a
narrative reported in biographies or war chronicles did not meet
with the strict conditions set by Hadith scholars, then, there were
others that supported it, or which offered circumstantial evidences,
thus elevating the narrative to the level of acceptance for historical
purposes. They also demonstrate that if Muslim historians did not
observe strict rules of acceptance or rejection that the Hadith scholars
had set for themselves, then, at least they had strong grounds to
report what they were reporting. [One might note in this connection
that if the rules of acceptance and rejection commonly observed by
the Muslim historians were applied to world historical writings,
perhaps very little would remain to report—Translator.]

Objectives
The objectives for the study of the Prophet's life can be several.
A few may be noted here.
1.

It helps,a Muslim apply to everyday life what he learns of the
commandments and injunctions as contained in the Qur an and

Sunnah (and as applied by the Prophet #| to his own life).
2.

Following the Prophet's example requires not a cursory, but a
close study of the details of his life, manners, activities, etc.,
during different phases of his life. Allah has said: "There is

indeed for you in the Prophet a good example for him who hopes for

The Prophet of Islam

16

Allah and the Hereafter, and who remembers Allah much."1 2
3.

Following the Prophet's example in every detail of life is a sign
of one's love of him. Allah said: "Say: If you love Allah, follow me,
ry

Allah will love you. '
4.

It helps learn about miracles and evidences that the Prophet
performed which go to prove his credibility and which in turn
strengthens one's faith in him.

5.

A thorough study of his life helps a person understand the
Qur'an better, having found how closely the two are related.

Sources
1. The Qur’an
The Qur'an, of course, is the first source for the biography of the
Prophet H;. It offers graphic details of various events of his life. Since
the preservation of the Qur'an in its pristine form is an indisputable
fact, it lends credence to what is preserved in Hadith and history
literature, which record the same events with greater details.
However, to profit fully from the Qur'an, one needs to deepen his
or her understanding of it. This is largely obtained through the
study of the type of commentaries that are known as Tafasir bilMathur (commentaries based on report). The Tafsir of Ibn Jarir
Tabari is the leading commentary of this kind. Next comes that of
Ibn Kathir, followed by Suyuti's Ad-Durr Al-Manthur3

2. Hadith

Hadith scholars such as Imam Bukhari, Muslim, Tirmidhi, or

others offer us a lot of material on the Prophet" s life, dealing with his
daily activities, manners, personal qualities, details of battles, etc.,
under separate headings. But, materials pertaining to other details
are spread far and wide in Hadith literature.4 Every collection of

Hadith has some information or the other to offer, either directly or
through implication. Then there are books written to describe the
Prophet's personal qualities, habits, apparel, and several other
things about his person — the class of books known as Shama'il. In
addition, there are works that deal specifically with his miracles or
evidences of his authenticity as a Prophet. To get an idea of the vast
amount of material available, one may cite the example of a single
work: Ahmad bin Hanbal's Musnad. In the rearranged version of
Sa'ati, almost the entire volumes 13, 20, 21 and 22 are devoted to
various aspects of the Prophet's life. We might remind that the

Musnad alone has, depending on how they are counted, anything
between thirty to forty thousand traditions.5

3. Biography Works and War Chronicles
These contain the bulk of material on the life of the Prophet ip,
especially the details. The first to enter the field were led by one of
the Prophet's Companions: 'Abdullah bin 'Abbas. He was followed
by such noted second-generation scholars as Sa'eed bin Sa'd
Khazraji, Sahl bin Abu Hathmah Ansari, 'Urwah bin Zubayr,
Sa'eed bin Musaiyab, and several others. The second century of
Islam saw an explosion of activities. Qasim bin Muhammad bin Abu
Bakr, Wahb bin Munabbih, Abul-Aswad, Musa bin 'Uqbah,
Muhammad bin Ishaq, and several others dominated the field. By
the third century of course, there were as many in the field as to
need a whole volume to describe their activities.

4

We might point out here that Hadith collectors of the like of Bukhari,
Muslim, the rest of the six. Imam Ahmad, Hakim and others have made
great contributions towards the preservation of details concerning the life
of the Prophet slf.

The Prophet of Islam

18

Of the leading chroniclers of the third generation, the better
known are Ibn 'Uqbah (parts of whose works were published by
Edward Sachau along with German translation); Ibn Ishaq, a major
portion of whose contribution is preserved in Ibn Hisham s work
(edited by Dr. Hamidullah of India); and Waqidi (whose work was
published in three volumes by Marsdon Jones). Ibn Sa'd is another
prolific writer who left behind him a massive work in seven
volumes, of which the first and second volumes deal with the life
of the Prophet ^.6 Two volumes of Fizari's Siratur-Rasul were
recently discovered in the library

of Qarawiyyin University,

Morocco, and as edited by Dr. Faruq Hamadah, are to appear
shortly in print form. Quite a few of course both ancient and
modern are still in manuscript form, spread in the libraries of the
vast Islamic world.

Ibn Ishaq:
Of the above, perhaps the most famous is the work of Ibn Ishaq
(d. 150 AH) entitled Sirat Rasulullah. His wide knowledge,
sequential method of narration, and combination of several reports
into one to offer a summary, are some of the reasons why he has
been popularly read.7 The above are also the reasons for the
popularity of Waqidi and his pupil Ibn Sa'd,8 but Ibn Ishaq remains
the more referenced.
A descendent of a freed slave of Iraq,9 Ibn Ishaq was brought up
in Madinah where he joined the study circles of the leading scholars
of the time. Some have questioned his dependability. One of the

6

See Ziyad Muhammad Mansur, Muqaddimah. His verification of At-Tabaqat
of Ibn Sa'd, p. 51. Professor Ziyad has recounted several narratives that

7

Ibn Sa'd took from his various masters.
See these points in Dr. Faruq Hamadah, Masddirus-Siratin-Nabaiviyyah wa

8

Taqwimuha, pp. 71-72.
We might remember that Ibn Sa'd depended to a large extent on Waqidi

9

for his knowledge of the Sirat.

19

reasons was that he was accused of being a Qadari.10 Imam Bukhari
for instance did not use his narratives except in hung reports.* 11
However, men like Shu'bah bin Hajjaj, a major Hadith scholar of his
time, treated him with great respect calling him Amirul-Mu'minin filHadith. Yahya bin Ma'in, another great Hadith critic, declared him
trustworthy. Yahya bin Sa'eed Qattan, Ahmad bin Hanbal, Yahya
bin Sa'eed Ansari, and several other scholars cleared him. Ibn
Sayyidin-Nas12 and Khatib Baghdadi13 have recorded for posterity
all the opinions that were .voiced about him.
However, that was about him in the field of Hadith, where very
strict measures prevail. In biography and war chronicles, his
mastery is acknowledged by consensus.14
His work's importance was enhanced by Ibn Hisharn who
abridged it and worked through only one of his sources: Bakka'i.15

10 The Qadariyah say that Allah's slaves carry out deeds that Allah does not
will and which Allah has not decreed, such as, e.g., fornication, murder,
etc. See 'Abdullah Sallum Samarra'i: Al-Ghulu wal-Firaqul-Ghaliyyah filHadaratil-Islamiyyah, p. 272.
11 What is meant by a Suspended (Mu'allaq) report is the deletion of one or
two narrators at the top. Sometimes this defect is clearly stated by the use
of the term, "He said," but at other times not, rather by saying, "It is
said." See Ibn Hajar: Hadyus-Sari, ch. 4, p. 15 and what follows. For an
example of the Suspended report, see Bukhari/AZ-Fflf/i (15/141/The Book
of Maghazi)
12 'Uyunul-Athar fi Fununil-Maghazi was-Siyar, pp. 8-17.
13 Tdrikh Baghdad (1/214-215).
14 See his life in biography works. The following have been my own books
of reference: Ibn Sayyidin-Nas, studies of Dr. Salman Hamud 'Awdah; Dr.
Hamadah; Studies of Shaykh Muhammad bin Rizq Tarhuni.
15 He is Ziyad bin 'Abdullah bin Tufayl Bakka'i 'Amiri (d. 183 AH). Ibn
Hajar said about him in his At-Taqrib: "A reliable man in war chronicles.
But his reports from other than Ibn Ishaq are not so reliable. Bukhari has
reported through him once." I might point out that Suhayli said (1/6):
"This person, Bakka'i, is reliable through whom Bukhari reported in his
Kitabul-Jihad while Muslim reported through him in several places. This
should be enough to accept him. Sometimes Ziyad mentioned through
Humayd Tawil. Bukhari mentioned Waki' in his Tdrikh and said, "Ziyad is
more honorable than that he should lie."

The Prophet of Islam

20

He ignored not only non-Bakka i narratives, but also those which
did not deal directly with the Prophet's biography, such as, e.g.,
poetry that was said by the Companions and others at the time
important events took place.16

Waqidi:
A resident of Baghdad (d. 207 AH), he was another writer who
was distrusted by some but trusted by others in Hadith. Bukhari,
Razi, Nasa'i and Daraqutni, for instance, considered him a pariah in

Hadith. But Darawardi, Yazid bin Harun, Abu Bakr San'am, Ibrahim
Harbi17 and several others accepted his traditions. Ibn Sayyidin-Nas
has gathered together all the opinions about him.18 And, once again,
no one denies his dependability in biographical matters or war
reports.

19

What distinguishes him is his treatment of the subject. His
narratives follow an organized and logical pattern. For example,
when narrating the campaigns, he started with a list of all those who

another, stating the dates, discussing the geography of the places,
ending with after other details the passwords that the Muslims used

He remained in Waqidi's company for so long that he came to be
known as his secretary. In fact, Waqidi used to dictate to him. But
that seems to have become his problem. For, he became unaccep¬
table to those who distrusted Waqidi. The most damaging opinion
was of Ibn Ma'in who accused him of lying (in Hadith matters).21
Ziyad Mansur22 has mentioned the opinions of the critics and noted
that Ibn Ma'in was a very severe critic.
It seems the critics did not have much against him, but rather
against those from whom he reported. For example, Ibn Salah
remarks, "He was himself trustworthy, but transmitted through
untrustworthy narrators, such as Waqidi."23 Nevertheless, we find
renowned scholars of Hadith such as Abu Hatim Razi, Dhahabi, or
Ibn Hajar declaring him trustworthy. Further, if Ibn Sa'd's chains of
narration had a few weak transmitters, it is nothing special to him.
Several scholars of repute have also narrated through such
transmitters.
4. Books on the Two Holy Harams

Books of this class also provide source material for the life of the
Prophet
One of the best and perhaps the most ancient is the one
written by Abu Walid Muhammad bin 'Abdullah Azruqi (d. 250
AH). Another was by Fakihi (d. 280 AH) who wrote the history of
Makkah and Madinah. Westfield's edited work lists Fakihi's
additions to Azruqi's. 'Umar bin Shabbah (d. 262 AH) was another
important contributor who wrote Tdrikhul-Madinah. Ahmad Fasi (d.
882 AH), originally of Morocco, who had migrated to Makkah, has
two titles on the history of Makkah.24

material for the life history of the Prophet #§. The most extensive is
that of Ibn Jarir Tabari (d. 310 AH) who wrote the massive Tarikhul-

Umami war-Rusuli ival-Muluk. He was very knowledgeable in Hadith.
He did not apply Hadith principles to historical matters. But of
course, as he wrote in the preface to his work, "...we have presented
here what was narrated to us."25 (He means of course, by
trustworthy people.)
Another historian, Khalifah bin Khayyat 'Usfuri (d. 240 AH),
actually preceded Tabari but his contribution is modest. He has
around fifty pages on the Prophet's life in his Tarikh in which he
took all the material from Ibn Ishaq, but only through two of his
narrators: Bakr bin Sulaymam6 and Wahb bin Jarir bin Hazim.'Usfuri himself was a trustworthy transmitter of Hadith28 of such
caliber that Bukhari reported through him, hence, his reports are
better authenticated.
Baladhuri (d. 355 AH—Futuhul-Buldan), Ahmad bin Jafar bin
Wahb (d. 292 AH — Tarikh Ya'qubi), Mas'udi (d. 346 AH -Murujudh-

Dhahab) Ibn 'Asakir (d. 571 AH — Tarikh Dimashqul-Kabir), Hafiz
Dhahabi (d. 748 AH — Tdrikhul-lslam), and Ibn Kathir (d. 774 -Al-

Bidayah wan-Nihayah) are some of the major contributors of history
works. These books of course contain both well authenticated as
well unauthenticated reports.^

weakness. When he narrates through memory he commits errors, AfTaqrib, p. 138.

provide some source material. Of the earliest is perhaps Jahiz (d. 255
AH), who wrote Al-Bayan wat-Tabyin and Al-Haywan. Others have
followed such as Mubarrad who wrote Al-Kamil, or Abu Bakr
Muhammad bin Qasim Anbari (d. 317 AH) who wrote Al-Waqf walIbtida' wal-Addad. The best known of the later authors is perhaps
Abul-Faraj Isfahani (d. 356 AH) who wrote Al-Aghdni. However,
most reports in these books are not well examined, nor the authors
themselves were much concerned about this aspect. Abul-Faraj's
work and personality have been much discussed. One might see Ibn
Kathir in this connection.10

History of Makkah

Establishment of the City and its Development

Ibrahim
migrated from Iraq to Sham, then from there to
Egypt carrying with him the message of One God31 He was
accompanied by his wife Sarah. She happened to be a beautiful
woman. Now, it was the custom of the Egyptian ruler of the time
that he took away every beautiful woman for himself. But Allah ($g)
willed that he should not succeed with Sarah, rather, she should
return from him with a slave-girl to serve her. That was Hagar,
Isma'il's mother.
Sarah herself happened to be sterile. Moreover, Ibrahim 8S&1 was
getting old and his hair was turning gray. So she decided to gift the
maid to him so that he could marry her in the hope that Allah will
bestow him progeny through her. Allah willed that Hagar should
bear him the first son. He named him Isma'il.33
Nevertheless, once Hagar had given birth to Ismail, Sarah was
led to jealousy and vowed that she would cut her up into three

31 See Verse 120 of Surat An-Nahl: "Ibrahim was indeed a model, devoted to
Allah, (a man) of pure faith, and not (at all) of the idolaters." His story of
encounter with the idols and the pagans of his time is well-known. The
Qur'an spoke of it in several places, e.g., Al-An'am (73-73), Al-Anbiya' (5170), Maryam (46-48), Al-Baqarah (258-260) and At-Tawbah (26). As for his
story of Tawhid in Makkah, see it in Surat Ibrahim in Verses 37, 99-111 and
in As-Sajfdt 102.
32 See Al-Bukhdri/Al-Fath (13/134-135/H. 3358). See the details of her story in
Ibn Hajar's commentary on this Hadith, pp. 134-137.
33 See the report as a narrative of Ibn 'Abdul-Hakam: Futiih Misr, p. 12,
through a Weak (Da'if) chain; and Azruqi: Akhbar Makkah (1/54). However
Azruqi's chain is also Da'if.

pieces.34 So Hagar fled with her husband. She tied to her waist a loin
cloth that dangled at the rear wiping out her footprints. Ibrahim led
her and her child to a place known as Doha, close to where the
Sacred House is, under a tree a little above the Zamzam spring.
There was no Makkah then and no inhabitants.35 There was no
water either. He left with her a small sack containing some dates
and a waterskin filled with water. As Ibrahim turned to leave,
Hagar followed him. She asked, "Where are you going, leaving us
in this deserted place?" She repeated the question several times but
he wouldn't turn to her. Finally she asked, "Has Allah ordered you
to do this?" He replied, "Yes." She said, "Then, surely He will not
abandon us," and returned. Ibrahim
continued until when he
was at mountain path, from where he couldn't be seen, he turned
toward the place and prayed:
Ujj

"O our Lord. I have settled my progeny in an uncultivable valley
near Your House, that they may, O our Lord, establish Your
worship. So induce some people's hearts to incline to them, and
provide them with fruits so that they may give thanks."3b
It wasn't too long before the water was exhausted. Both Hagar
and her child were thirsty. It was especially painful for her to see the
infant writhe his limbs in suffering. She climbed the nearest hill
called Safa to see if she could spot someone. Not finding anyone, she
lifted her robe a little and ran down across the length of the valley to
climb another hill called Marwah to see if she could find a living
soul. She didn't find anyone and ran between the hills several times.

34 Ibn Hajar: Al-Fath (13/141 /explanation of H. 3364).
35 Azruqi narrated (Akhbar Makkah, 1/54) through a Weak (Da'if) chain, that
the 'Amaliq (a tribe in those days having big and strong bodies) used to
live outside of it.
36 See Verse 37 of Surat Ibrahim.

History of Makkah

27

(This, Prophet Muhammad #§ has told us is the origin of the Sa'i
ritual in Hnjj and 'Umrah.) At the end of the seventh round, Jibril
came down. He used either his heel or wing to locate the source of
the Zamzam spring and dug until water began to sprout forth.
Hagar hedged the springing water with some sand all around (in
order not to let it flow off). As the level arose, she cupped her hands
to collect it in her waterskin. The water kept coming up steadily.
[Tire Prophet ^ commented, "May Allah show mercy to Isma'il's
mother. Had she left it to itself (it would have continued to flow)."
Or he said, "Had she not scooped, Zamzam would have been a
sweet running spring."]3' She drank from it and continued to nurse
her child. The angel told her, "Do not be afraid of at being
abandoned. This is the House of the Lord. This child and his father
will build it. Allah does not abandon His slaves."
While she held to the place, one of the families of Jurhum tribe
originating from the Qahtan of the Yemen happened to pass by.
Discovering that water was available there, they sought her
permission to settle down. She placed the condition that the spring
will remain her property (although they could draw from it). They
agreed and later sent for the rest of the tribe to come and join them.
Hagar's child grew into a handsome young man. He had learnt
Arabic from the tribe. He pleased them and as he grew up into
manhood, they gave him one of their girls in marriage.38
Ibrahim

visited them several times. Once he visited when

Hagar was dead. Isma'il

wasn't around. His wife told him that

he had gone out fob an errand. When Ibrahim asked her about how
they managed to live, she began to complain of the hardship they
faced. He left the message with her that when Isma'il returned, she
was to convey him his greetings and tell him to change the threshold
of his house. When Isma'il mB returned, his wife told him what had
happened. From the dejails of the account he knew that it was his

37 In a Bukhari's transmission he said, "May Allah show mercy to Isma il s
mother, had not she been hasty, it would have been a spring.

Bidayah wan-Nihdyah (1/209).

father. He also understood what he meant by the message and
divorced her to marry another woman. After some time Ibrahim
once again visited them and once again missed Isma'il. He asked his
new wife about how they lived. She thanked Allah for the
providence He had bestowed on them. Ibrahim departed leaving
the message that she was to convey to her husband his greetings
and tell him to retain his threshold. Isma'il knew that it was his
father. He also understood the message and retained his wife.
After that Ibrahim SSB stayed away quite a while to return and
find his son behind Zamzam under a tree, repairing his arrows. The
two met the way fathers and sons meet. Ibrahim asked him to help
him in the construction of the House that Allah (As) had ordered him
to build. It was built on a raised spot close to Zamzam. Isma'il
fetched stones and Ibrahim built until the walls were high enough.
Then they brought the stone known today as Maqam Ibrahim to use it
as a footstep to stand on and continue raising the walls higher. The
two were supplicating in words:

"0 our Lord! Accept from us, surely You are the Seeing, the
Knowing." 39,40
This however was not the first time that Isma'il
was helping
his father in obedience of Allah and execution of His Command.
Earlier, when he was in his teens, Ibrahim
had come down to
Makkah following a dream in which Allah revealed to him to
sacrifice his son to Him. Ibrahim consulted him in words:

"My son. I see in a dream that I am slaughtering you. So, what's
your opinion?"
Isma'il $£S\ replied:

39 Surat Al-Baqarah: 127.

"My father. Go ahead and do as you are ordered. You will find

called to him:

to announce for Hajj in words:

relayed his voice to every living being and everyone who was
destined to perform Hajj — until the Day of Judgment. And they
replied, "At your service O Lord, at your service."44
Ibrahim and Isma'il supplicated to their Lord in the words of
the Qur'an:

"O our Lord, send among them a Messenger from them to recite to

Tabari46has said that this supplication was made especially for
our Prophet Muhammad
The Prophet
used to say, "I am the
answer to the supplication of Ibrahim and the glad tiding
pronounced by 'Isa."
Isma'il $3 continued to live next to the Sacred House, by the side
of his in-laws, the Jurhum among whom he had married, until Allah
commissioned him as a Messenger to them and those living in the
Hijaz belt of the tribe of' Amaliq and those of the Yemen.4 Allah said:

Ibn Jubayr and others of the Salaf reported. Ibn Jarir brought it in (17/106107), as also Ibn Abu Hatim, in detail, as said Ibn Kathir.
45 Surat Al-Baqarah: 129. See its commentary in Tabari (3/82-88/Shakir)

Hakim in Al-Mustadrak (2/616-617) with the same chain as Ahmad adding:
"Sound (Sahih), on the conditions set by Muslim." Dhahabi agreed with
him. I might add that its chain is Good (Hasan) because it is through Ibn
Ishaq who was a Mudallas (dropped the immediate narrator above him).

He fathered 12 sons. Their names have been given by Ibn
Ishaq from whom Ibn Kathir quotes.49 The first two were Nabit
and Qaydhar. Nabit was the one who was chosen to be the
forefather of him who was raised in answer to the call of Ibrahim
and Isma'il (i.e., our Prophet jp;). However, the golden chain
between Nabit and 'Adnan is lost. There were six of them in the
chain. They all lived in Makkah. Yet, their names are not known.
Nevertheless, the Prophet s|| specifically said that he was born in
the line of 'Adnan. Beyond 'Adnan, there are several opinions
about the identities.50
When Isma'il $3 died, he was buried in the Hijr area by the
side of his mother's grave. It is said that he lived for 137 years. All
those who lived in the Hijaz belt affiliated themselves either to Nabit
or Qaydhar.51
It might also be pointed out here that the Ibrahimic period is
considered to be 1900 years before the appearance of Jesus tlSsiL

angels as stated by Azruqi.53

The third construction was at the hands of Adam's progeny as
reported by Azruqi56 and others.57 The report therein comes
through Wahb bin Munabbih. Suhayli58 however notes that the
third construction was by Shith bin Adam.
The fourth construction was at the hands of Ibrahim and
Isma'il. Ibn Kathir59 however thinks that this was the first
construction. He said, "We haven't received a single authentic
report from the Prophet $$, about a construction before that of
Ibrahim

Shami however has commented on Ibn Kathir's

opinion in words: "This statement needs reconsideration in view of
so many reports coming down that do not agree with it."
The fifth and the sixth constructions were that of the 'Amaliq
and Jurhum, as reported in the works of Shami,60 Ibn Abu
Shaybah61 and Ishaq bin Rahwayh. Ibn Jarir, Ibn Abu Hatim, and
Bayhaqi in his Ad-Dalail, also carry the report through 'Ali bin
Abu

Talib.

Suhayli

adds:

"It is

said

that

the House

was

constructed once or twice by the Jurhum because of a crack that
the Ka'bah wall had suffered due to floods. That means it was not
a new construction, rather repair work. It was 'Amir Jarud who
undertook the works.
The seventh construction was undertaken by Qusaiy bin Kilab —
the Prophet's ancestor. Shami62 has said about this report that it was
passed on by Zubayr bin Bakkar in his book Kitdbun-Nasb. Imam
Abu Ishaq Mawardi has confirmed this report in his book Al-

Ahkamus-Sul taniyyah.63

The eighth construction was accomplished by the Quraysh at
the time when the Prophet ^ was 35 years of age. This we will
discuss in detail presently.
The ninth construction was accomplished by 'Abdullah bin
Zubayr as reported in the Sahihayn64 and others. This will also be
discussed in detail in the coming chapters.
The tenth construction was undertaken by Hajjaj bin Yusuf on
the command of 'Abdul-Malik bin Marwan the Umayyad, as
reported by Muslim.65 However, 'Abdul-Malik later regretted when
he heard from 'Aishah -4 that she had heard the Prophet i| say, "If
not for your people so close to the pre-Islamic times, I would have
demolished the Ka'bah, added a roof to it, brought down the door to
ground level, and included the Hijr portion into it." Other reporters
also confirmed the report to the chagrin of 'Abdul-Malik.66
It is reported that Harun Rashid wished to reconstruct the
Ka'bah on the design of Ibn Zubayr. But Malik bin Anas opposed
the idea. He told the caliph, "For Allah's sake, O Leader of the
Faithful, don't render the House a plaything for those who come
after you — everyone modeling it the way he wishes, undermining
the respect that is reserved for it in the hearts of the people.

Harun

Rashid gave up the idea.67
We can sum up by saying that the statements in the Qur an and
the reports that appear in Bukhari and others, lead us to believe that
the Ka'bah was first constructed by Ibrahim and Ismail, peace upon

64 See Shami: Subulul-Huda war-Rashad (1/192-196).
65 In his Sahih (2/971/H. 1333/402).
66 Muslim (2/972/H. 1333/403), Suhayli (1/222), Shami (1/196).
67 Ibn Kathir stated that the one who tried to reduce it was Mahdi bin
Mansur. See Al-Bidayah (1/180). And Suhayli said (1/224) that Abu Ja'far
Mansur and his son Mahdi increased on the beautification of the mosque
and in its grandeur. Dr. Buti wrote: "However, according to the
commentaries of Nawawi on Muslim and of Al-Fath on Al-Bukhdri, it was
Rashid who thought of reducing the Ka'bah and it is mentioned in
'Uyunul-Athar (1/53) and in I'ldmus-Sajid that it was Abu Ja'far Mansur;
but we know that Imam Malik was a contemporary of Mansur and Harun
Rashid and hence the possibility remains."

them. At that time the House was on a hill overlooking the area
around. Until Ibrahim's construction, angels and the previous
Prophets were aware of the existence of the sacred spot there.
As for reports asserting that the construction had been done
earlier, well, so far as their line of transmission is concerned, they do
not go beyond a Companion or a Follower. These reports have been
carried by historians such as Azruqi and Fakihi, or those
commentators of the Qur'an who are not very particular about the
authenticity of reports, in contrast to the Hadith scholars who take
greater care about the chain of narration. Hence Ibn Kathir's
statement is worth keeping in mind that no trustworthy report has
come down to us from the Prophet -|§ to the effect that the House
had already been built before Ibrahim
Nonetheless, Ibn Shahbah68 adds to Ibn Kathir's statement the
following: "This statement does not contradict the report that there
hasn't been a Prophet but who performed pilgrimage to the House."
Abu Ya'la has a report in his collection narrated by Ibn 'Abbas
that the Prophet
performed his Hajj. When he arrived in the
'Asfan valley, he asked, "O Abu Bakr, what valley is this?" Abu
Bakr
replied that it was the 'Asfan valley. The Prophet said, 'Nuh,
Hud and Ibrahim have passed by this valley on their red camels led
by coiled halters, wearing a lower garment and an upper striped
cloak. They had come to perform the pilgrimage of the Ancient
House.' Musnad Ahmad has another report from Ibn 'Abbas ^ who
said that when the Prophet j|§ passed by the 'Asfan valley during
the pilgrimage, he asked, "Abu Bakr, what valley is this?" He told
him that it was the 'Asfan valley. The Prophet #§ said, "Hud and
Salih passed by this valley on red camels, coiled halters, wearing
lower garments and striped cloaks, uttering the supplicatory words
of pilgrimage of the Ancient House." The report is of Good (Hasan)
status. It may also be pointed out that pilgrimage does not
necessarily require a constructed house. It is enough if the spot is
known and identified.69

Ibn Zubayr’s Construction
When Ibn Zubayr ^ decided to reconstruct the Ka'bah, the
people brought down the walls right up to the ground level. They
constructed temporary posts all around and tied a cloth thereunto.
When they began the work, they added in length those six feet that
the Quraysh had decreased because they had run short of
construction material. They maintained the height as 10 feet, placing
two doors in the eastern and western walls —one for entry and the
other for exit. They did this following the Prophet's desire reported
by 'Aishah -A : "If not for ytmr people so close to the pre-Islamic
times, I would have demolished the Ka'bah, added to it what was
removed, brought down the door to ground level, placing two of
them, one for entry at the east side and another for exit at the west
side. If I did that, I would have rendered it back to the Ibrahimi
design." (Sahihayn).
Azruqi70 has stated that the height of the Ibrahimi construction
was 9 feet; the length 32 feet and width 22 feet. It was without a
roof. Suhayli71 states that "the height was 9 feet from the Isma'ili
times, over which the Quraysh had added 9 to make it 18 feet. It was
they who had lifted the door requiring a ladder for entry through it.
The first to add a lock to the door was Tubba'. In any case, when Ibn
Zubayr built it, he added another 9 feet to the height making it 27
feet. That is how it remains to this day."
As for Masjidul-Haram, in the beginning it didn't have
surrounding walls. Rather, it had residential quarters all around.
When 'Umar bin Khattab ^ saw that the houses were constricting
the pilgrims, he purchased the houses around and expanded the area.
He also added a boundary wall roughly of a man's height, placing
lamps on top. During the time of 'Uthman 4® it was once again felt
that the buildings around were constricting the space for the
pilgrims. So, he too purchased the properties around end expanded
the Haram area. Ibn Zubayr A did the same during his time.

Since that time, kings and rulers have gone on adding space to
the Haram area to meet with the ever increasing demands,72 right
into our times; the most massive of them being that of the Saudi
government.

Ibrahim’s Station (.Maqam)
Ibrahim's Maqam refers to the stone over which Ibrahim

had

stood to raise the walls when they became beyond his reach. His
footmarks remained on the stone. They lasted until Islam's advent.
Subsequently they were lost with the touches of the pilgrims. Abu
Talib said in a couplet:

On the stone Ibrahim stood
Soft is the mark of his feet.73
It is reported that earlier the stone was adjacent to the wall of
the Ka'bah, having been in that place since the time of Ibrahim
until the time of 'Umar *#>>. When it became an obstruction to the
people, 'Umar

got it moved to the present position. None of the

Companions ever objected to the relocation.74

72 See Azruqi (2/68-71 and what follows) and Suhayli: Ar-Rawd (1/224).
These authors detailed the expansion of the Ka'bah until their times.
73 Ibn Kathir: Al-Bidayah (1/177-179) and Tafsir (1/246).
74 Ahmad in Fadd'ilus-Salidbah (1/324) through 'Abdur-Razzaq, through a
chain reliable until 'Ata'; see Al-Musannaf (5/48) for a similar report. It has
another supporting transmission from Mujahid that 'Abdur-Razzaq docu¬
mented; Azruqi: Akhbar Makkah (2/33). Hafiz said in Al-Fath (8/169) that
Bayhaqi has a similar report coming from 'Aishah A with a Strong (Qaivi)
chain. It says that the Maqam was close by the House till the time of the
Prophet m and Abu Bakr 4b. It was 'Umar 4b who moved it away. Ibn
Abu Hatim also recorded through a reliable chain from Ibn 'Uyaynah that
he said, "The Maqam was adjacent to the House during the time of the
Prophet #£. It was 'Umar who moved it. Then came the floods that took it
far away. 'Umar got it replaced." However, Sufyan said, "I do not know
whether it was adjacent to the House or not." See Ahmad: Fadd'il (1/325):
the redactor's footnote. Ibn Kathir said in his Tafsir (1/246) after
recounting the reports of 'Ata', Mujahid through 'Abdur-Razzaq and the
report of 'Aishah ^ which is with Bayhaqi: "This chain is Sound (Sahih)."

'Umar
had also suggested to the Prophet
"It would be
nice if we prayed near the Station of Ibrahim." It was approved by
the revelation which said:

"And take Ibrahim's Station for prayer."75'76
It is worth mentioning that it was Ibrahim
who had built
Masjidul-Aqsa at Jerusalem, although another report is that it was
Ya'qub
who built it. The time gap between the two constructions
was 40 years as said by the Prophet H5.77
As regards the Hadith in Nasa'i which says that it was Sulayman
who built Masjidul-Aqsa, it is its renewal that is meant, as Suyuti,78
Ibn Qaiyim79 and Ibn Hajar80 have clarified. Abu Shahbah81 is also
of the same opinion.

And, after recounting the report of Sufyan which is with Ibn Abu Hatim
he said, "These reports strengthen each other."

THE WORLD SITUATION
BEFORE ISLAM
During the sixth and seventh centuries, the world was engulfed
by the dark shadows of paganism and superstition, and the human
society was built on tribalism that divided itself into classes. The
social and political anarchy was at its zenith. All that was good,
whether it had its source in tradition or in prophetic teachings, was
lost. The Prophet jjj| well expressed the situation when he said,
"Allah looked down upon the peoples of the earth and disapproved
of them: the Arabs as well as the non-Arabs, except for the remnants
of those that had been given the Book earlier."8
In the following pages we shall briefly present the situation to
highlight the necessity for a new Prophet, mentioning also the basic
criteria that were, are, and will remain, the foundations for building
up a proper human civilization.

82 Muslim recorded it as part of a long report. By the words "the remnants
of those that had been given the Book earlier" the allusion is to those few
that were left holding on to the true religion.

The Arabian Peninsula
The Political Situation

Yemen
The oldest of the Arab peoples known to have inhabited
Yemen are the Sabeans (inhabitants of Sheba). They find mention
in the Qur'an also. The peak of their civilization and power seems
to have been in the 1100 BC. By 300 CE, the Himyar tribe seems to
have overpowered them. With that Yemen began to suffer decline
and the Qahtani tribes started to migrate from there to various
other places.
Two hundred and seventy years before the entry of Islam,
Yemen was the subject of continuous internal wars and turmoil,
allowing foreigners to take a foothold in the lands. First, the Romans
entered into Aden, and with their help, the Abyssinians were able to
extend their influence for the first time in the year 340 CE. They had
profited from the quarrels between the two tribes Hamdan and
Himyar. Their occupation lasted until 378 CE. After that the land
enjoyed some respite. But then Allah struck them with the calamity
of the great floods known as the Arim floods. That happened either
in 450 or 451 CE. With that the Ma'arib dam, which was a means of
welfare and affluence for them,83 was swept away. These events
were the result of their rebellion against Allah. These are His ways
with those who deviate.
In the year 523 CE/their king Dhu Nuwas launched a campaign
to force Christians to abandon their religion. When they resisted, he
ordered ditches to be dug, got them filled with fire and then got the

83 See Ya'qubi: At-Tarikh (1/205)

42

The Prophet of Islam

Christians cast into them. It is about them that Allah (*Jg) spoke in

Surat Al-Buruj saying:

Destroyed be the people of the Ditch ,.."84
That prompted the Romans to persuade the Abyssinians to
occupy Yemen a second time. It happened under the leadership of
Aryat in the year 525 CE. He remained the ruler of Yemen until one
of his commanders Abrahah seized power from him. The latter was
officially declared ruler of Yemen after he managed to win the
approval of the Abyssinian king. It was Abrahah who took up the
campaign to destroy the Ka'bah. But Allah prevented him with His
Power. The Qur'anic chapter entitled The Elephant speaks of this
episode.
The people of Yemen sought and obtained the help of the Iranians
to push out the Abyssinians in the year 575 BC. Ma'dikarib bin Sayf
bin Yazan Himyari played the leading role and so the Persians
declared him king. However, some Abyssinian slaves who were left
in the retinue assassinated him. With his death, his family lost the rule
and the Persian emperor appointed a Persian governor of San'a,
declaring the Yemen85 an Iranian province. The last of such governors
was Bazan, the one who embraced Islam in the seventh Hijrah year, or
628 CE.86 With that the Persian hold over the Yemen was lost for good.

84 Surat Al-Buruj: 4-8. Ya'qubi has recorded a part of the story in his Tarikh (1/119).
85 See Ya'qubi (1/200) and Dr. Muhammad Jamaluddin Surur: QiyamudDawlatil-‘Arabiyyah fi Haydt Muhammad, pp. 25-31; Ralnqul-Makhtum, pp.
28-30. The writer of this last work took it from Tafliimul-Qur'dn (4/195198) and Tarikh Ardul-Qur’dnul-Karim (1/133 and what follows) adding,
"There are great differences between the history books with regard to the
date. Some have said about these details that these are 'tales of the
ancients.' See ATBidayah (1/174-198) all of them through Ibn Ishaq, except
for a few that are not through him. Further, they are either Suspended
(Mu'allaq), Interrupted (Munqati') or Disconnected (Mursal). Of course,
what is proven by the Qur'an there is no second opinion to it.

The Arabian Peninsula

The Hira Kingdom
The Persians had ruled Iraq and its surrounding areas since the
time of Chosroes the Great (557-529 BC). Then they were invaded by
Alexander the Macedonian in the year 326 BC. Anarchy reigned till
320 BC. During these years the Qahtanis migrated and occupied a
part of the fertile lower lands. They were followed by the 'Adnani
tribes. The two however - clashed and the former pushed on to
occupy the Euphrates basin.
Ardshir, the founder of the Sassanid rule in the year 226 BC,
organized the Persians and got better of the Arabs living on the
borders of their kingdom. This was the reason why Quda ah (tribe)
migrated from there to Sham. The people of Hira and Anbar
however submitted to the rule. Nevertheless, finding it difficult to
control this region from the capital, the Persians appointed one of
their men, Jadhimah Waddah, governor, helping him out with some
Persian militia. This was to keep the Romans and Arab Syrians in
check The latter had been similarly placed by the Romans (in order
to keep the Persians in check). Of the rulers of Hira, the most famous
was Nu'man bin Mundhir. He is the one who rebelled against the
Persians, fought against them at Dhi Qar and defeated them. This
happened after the birth of the Prophet Jg. It is said that it was the
first time that the Arabs overcame the non-Arabs.

The Prophet

is reported to have said, "This was the first time that the Arabs were
able to wrench justice from the non-Arabs, and they were helpe
because of me."88

The Syrian Kingdom
The period during which waves of Arab tribes migrated to
Sham, the innermost families of Quda'ah went over to Syrian plains
to take up inhabitation there. These were of the Banu Sulayh bin

Hulwan of whom were born the Banu Daj'am bin Sulayh. They
were known as Banu Daja'imah. The Romans used them as barriers
between themselves and the Bedouin Arabs on one side, while on
the other as barriers against the Persians. They appointed one of
their prominent men as potentate. They remained the rulers until
the Ghassanians overcame them. The Romans let the Ghassamans
prevail, maintaining their own hold, until the famous Yarmuk battle
in the 13th year after Hijrah (634 AC). That event was also marked
by the entry of the last of their rulers Jabalah bin Ayham into the
fold of Islam. Those were the days of 'Umar's caliphate.89

Hijaz
In Hijaz, political unity did not exist for the area to ever acquire
the status of a kingdom. There were many towns, but each followed
its own political system which was nearer to being a Shaykhdom
rather than a kingdom. The major cities of those times were
Makkah, Yathrib and Ta'if.

Makkah
In our account of the development of Makkah, we have stated
that its original inhabitants were the Jurhum tribes, although it is
claimed that the 'Amaliq had lived in the outskirts before the arrival
of the Jurhums.90
After Ism'ail

the Jurhum tribe did not show keenness to

maintain the sanctity of the Haram. Disturbances and dissension
followed. Materials gifted to the Ka'bah were stolen. Water level in
Zamzam went down and things came to such a pass that even the
knowledge of its whereabouts was lost. When some of the Yemeni

Arabs dispersed after the 'Arim floods, Tha'labah bin 'Amr bin
'Amir migrated to Makkah along with his kinsfolk. Initially, the
Jurhum tribe resisted. Fighting broke out between Tha'labahs and
Jurhums in which the Jurhums were routed.
When Tha'labah became sick, he went away to Sham handing
over the Makkan rule and custodianship of the Ka'bah to a cousin of
his called Rab'iah bin Harithah bin 'Amr who was from Luhaiy
tribe. He identified his people as Khuza'ah. Banu Isma'il did not
take part in the fight between Jurhum and Tha'labah.
From then on until some three hundred years, or according to
another opinion five hundred years, the Khuza ah remained
custodians of the House. At that time the Quraysh were a divided
house in Banu Kinanah until Qusaiy bin Kilab took charge and
united them. Qusaiy also quarreled with the Khuza'ah over the
custodianship of the House. Quda'ah aided him in the struggle that
ensued, with other Arab tribes also taking part from either side.
Finally, the custodianship fell to Qusaiy. From that day onward the
Quraysh came to occupy a high position among the Arabs.
Qusaiy divided Makkah into four parts and settled the Quraysh
in each of its parts. He kept to himself all the important religious
functions, such as custody of the keys of the Ka'bah, the right to
water the pilgrims, feeding the pilgrims, presiding over the
assemblies and handing out war banners and standards. He also
built up a house of justice naming it Darun-Nadwah. He imposed a
tax on the Quraysh. The sums thus obtained were spent on the
welfare of the pilgrims.
When he grew old, Qusaiy handed over these functions to the
eldest of his sons 'Abdud-Dar. After the death of 'Abdud-Dar and
his brothers viz., 'Abd Munaf, 'Abd Shams, and 'Abd, differences
arose between their sons over the functions. They split mto those
supporting Banu 'Abdud-Dar and those supporting 'Abd Munaf.
While swearing allegiance, Banu 'Abd Munaf dipped their hands in

a cup of perfume and rubbed them against the Ka'bah wall. They
were known as the Mutayyibun. In contrast, the Banu 'Abdud-Dar
dipped their hands in a pot of blood, rubbing their hands against the
Ka'bah walls. They were known as the Ahlaf
Nonetheless, the two parties came to peace and decided to split
the functions between themselves. The functions of feeding and
watering the pilgrims were given away to Banu 'Abd Munaf. That
of custody of the House, war banners, and the presidency in DarunNadwah was to be the privilege of Banu 'Abdud-Dar. Later, the
functions taken over by Banu 'Abd Munaf were split between two
families: Hashim and his brother 'Abd Shams. Watering the
pilgrims and feeding them went to Hashim while the presidency
went to 'Abd Shams.92
Nevertheless, as the status of Hashim grew, jealousy also grew,
in particular that of his nephew Umaiyah bin Abd Shams. He tried
to take away the feeding of the pilgrims from him but could not.
Having failed, he earned the taunts of his kinsfolk, which increased
his jealousy and hatred for his uncle.
Muttalib inherited the job of feeding the pilgrims after the death of
his brother Hashim. With his death it went to his nephew 'AbdulMuttalib bin Hashim; and, after his death, 'Abbas bin 'Abdul-Muttalib
inherited it. The Prophet #§ left it with him after the fall of Makkah.
As noted earlier, the family of 'Abdud-Dar inherited the
custodianship of the banner and the presidency of Darun-Nadwah.
When Makkah fell to the Prophet m, he left the honor with them and
returned the key of the House to 'Uthman bin Talhah. It remains in
their hands till today. It is said that the Verse:

"Surely Allah orders you to restore the trusts to those they
belong,"93

was revealed in this connection.94 Tabari doesn't think it improb¬
able,9' although he cites several other opinions.

Yathrib
The first of those to take up residence in this town were the
'Amaliqah. Later, they were overcome by the Jews, especially
during the first and the second centuries after Christ, following their
persecution at the hands of the Romans in Sham. They had then
begun to disperse to various parts of the world. Several tribes,
notably Banu Nadir and Banu Qurayzah came down to Yathrib.
Subsequently the town received the Aws and Khazraj tribes
migrating from Yemen in consequence of the destruction of the
Ma'arib dam.96
The Aws and Khazraj tribes and the Jews lived in peace for
quite a while entering into a variety of treaties. However, when Aws
and Khazraj grew powerful, the Jews became wary of them and
broke the treaties. Aws and Khazraj sought the aid of their km
Ghassanids. They lent them help to counter the Jewish efforts to
gain supremacy.''7
Also, Aws and Khazraj lived peacefully among themselves for
quite a while. But with the passage of time enmity grew between
them, leading to wars. Khazraj held the upper hand most of the
time. Aws tried to recruit Quraysh to their cause but failed. That
forced them to forge a treaty with Banu Qurayzah and Banu Nadir.
When the Khazraj got wind of it they sent a delegation to confirm
the news. The Jews let them know that they were not interested in
war against them. Khazraj demanded a guarantee supported by 40
young men to live with them as security. Therefore, when they

The Prophet of Islam

broke the agreement, the Khazraj gave them the choice of either
exile or the lives of the forty. They chose to leave. But Ka'b bin Asad
Qurazi convinced them to stay put even at the cost of those that
were mortgaged. Therefore, Khazraj slaughtered the forty men in
their custody. This angered the Jews and they openly declared their
treaty with Aws. They stood with them during the battle of Bu'ath
and Aws emerged victorious. Many of the Khazraj were killed in the
aftermath. That led to an uneasy peace between Khazraj and Aws.
Finally, they agreed to set up a kind of joint rule with 'Abdullah bin
Ubaiy bin Salul Khazraji98 as the head. But, as they were preparing
the grounds for laying the foundations for this new set up, the
Prophet $|§ happened to emigrate to Yathrib. Islam spread so fast
that most people completely set aside the idea of forming a
government under 'Abdullah bin Ubaiy, preferring to assemble
rather under the banner of Islam. Ibn Ubaiy was left with no choice
but to outwardly embrace Islam after the Badr victory. Nonetheless,
he remained a hypocrite all along as we shall see later. There isn't
any difference in opinion about this man's hypocrisy among the
scholars of the Qur'an, Hadith, or history. As for the leader of the
Aws tribe, Abu 'Amir bin Sayfi bin Nu'man, the father of Abu
Hanzalah who was given a wash by angels, this man chose to
remain a disbeliever and so moved away to Makkah. From there he
moved on to Ta'if, migrating from there to Sham. Everywhere, he
tried to do everything he could to destroy Islam. He had taken up to
asceticism during the pre-Islamic times and so was known as the
Monk. The Prophet
said, "Don't call him a monk, rather 'the
wicked'."99

Ta’if
Initially Ta'if used to be known as Wajj, borrowing its name
from Wajj bin 'Abdul-Haiy. He was one of the 'Amaliqah

(Amalekites) to have taken up residence there. The Hawazin tribes
of the outlying areas also joined him there. Later, one of the chiefs of
the Hawazin called Qasb bin Munabbih bin Bakr bin Hawazin
married off his daughter to one of the chiefs of Wajj called 'Amir
'Adwani. From thereon Qasb came to be known as Thaqif. When
they grew in numbers, they built walls around their dwellings that
later developed into a fort. The fort came to be known as Ta'if
(something that surrounds), after the walls that surrounded their
dwellings. Thereafter Wajj100 was relinquished in favor of Ta'if.
At the time of the advent of Islam, the Banu Thaqif were
divided into two groups: Banu Malik and Ahlaf Friction between
them led them to wars from which the Ahlaf emerged victorious.
They expelled Banu Malik beyond into the valleys of Ta'if. So Banu
Malik worked out treaties with the adjoining tribes to strengthen
themselves militarily. They joined hands with Daws, Khath'am and
others, against the Ahlaf. Nevertheless, no wars were reported
1 01
between them.

Religious Condition
Khuza'ah managed to keep the trusteeship of the Ka'bah for
three to five hundred years. But they proved to be evil trustees. For,
it was during their time that idol-worship entered into the Arabian
Peninsula. One of their chiefs called 'Amr bin Luhaiy10- had
traveled to Sham where he found the 'Amalekites in Mo'ab
worshipping idols. When he inquired about the functions of those
idols, he was told that when they supplicated to them for rains or
sought other help, they received the rains and the help they had
sought. So he asked them to donate an idol to him. They gave him
Hubal. He brought it down to Makkah and persuaded the people to

102 Muslim documented (4/2191/H. 2856) that the Prophet *y§ said, I saw
'Amr bin Luhaiy dragging his entrails in the Fire." This was because of
his reprehensible act.

offer their devotions to it. From thereon, whenever Banu Ismail
traveled they took a stone from the Haram with them, pitching it
whenever they encamped and circumambulating it in the manner of
the Sacred House. That practice led the masses to choose the best
shaped stones around for worship. This is how those who were on
the religion of Ibrahim103 ended up becoming idol-worshippers.
Every major tribe had its own stone-god. For instance, Banu Kalb
bin Murrah of Dumatul-Jandal owned a deity called Wudd. Banu
Hudhayl who lived in a place called Rihat, some three nights off
Makkah, owned a deity called Suwa7: Banu An am possessed a deity
called Yaguth, which was also the deity of the people of Jursh from
Madhhij tribe in Yemen. Another idol was Ya uq that belonged to
Banu Khaywan of the Hamdani tribes, while on the other hand,
Nasr was the chief god of Dhul-Kala of Himyar.
These were the very idols that the people of Nuh had
worshipped as noted by the Qur an. It reported to us the words
of those people:

"And they have said, 'Don't give up your deities, nor give up

//105

When Isma'il's children and others abandoned the religion of
Ibrahim, they took to worshipping these idols.106
103 lbn Kathir: Al-Biddyah (2/205); Ya'qubi: At-Tdrikh (1/254); Ibn Wardi: AtTdrikh (1/65) - all their chains are Da1 if.
104 Ibn Ishaq without a chain — Ibn Hisham (1/123-132), so it is Da'if.
105 Surat Niih: 23-24. See the story of these idols with Ya'qubi, At-Tdrikh (1/
255): with Ibn Abu Shaykh in his book Al-'Azamah; Bukhari, Ibn Hajar: AlFath (18/312-314/explanation of H. 4920). He states that Yaghuth was
originally for the Murad tribe. Then for Banu Ghatif living near Sheba.
This to us is correct for Ibn Ishaq's statement that Yaghuth was for Banu
An'am of Tay' is not so reliable because the areas of Tay' and Madhhij are
far apart: the former in the north while the latter in Yemen.
106In sum, and as documented by Al-Bukhdri/Al-Fath (18/303/H. 4920) and

The Arabian Peninsula

51

The Khawlan tribe had a deity that was called either 'Amm
Anas or 'Amyanus. They divided their charity between it on one
side and Lord God of the universe on the other. It is about them that
Allah (3g) revealed:

"And they have declared shares (for other than Allah) out of what
Allah created of the'crops and livestock."107
Similarly, Banu Malakan bin Kinanah had a deity of their own
called Sa'd. Daws tribe had their own in the image of 'Amr bin
Hamamah. The Quraysh had christened deities that were special to
them, such as Isaf and Na'ilah. They stood near the Zamzam well. It
is at this spot that they offered their sacrifices. 'Aishah %> said, "We
had always heard that the pair Isaf and Na'ilah committed
fornication in the Haram and were turned to stones."108
But that was not all. Every family had deities special to it. The
last thing they would do before leaving the town or the first thing
they would do arriving from a journey was to touch them. When
Allah ($§) sent the Prophet j|g with the message of One God, they
criticized him saying:

"Has he made a single deity out of several? Surely, this is a
strange thing."109
Abu Raja' 'Utaridi says in a trustworthy report, "When we

others, discussing the idols of the people of Nuh, that they were originally
names of pious persons among them. When they died, Satan inspired
them to plant in the places they sat their idols naming them by their
names. They did so, and when, that generation was gone, those who
followed began to worship them. When the Flood came, they got buried
under the mud. They remained so until the satans pulled them out for the
Arabs. See Ibn Hajar: Al-Fath (18/312).

didn't find a good and shapely stone in the days of Ignorance, we
gathered some dust, made a heap of it, brought a goat and milked
on it. Then we circumambulated it."110
Ibn Kathir* 111 has reported several trustworthy Ahadith about
the role of 'Amr bin Luhaiy in the founding of the religion of idols.
One of them of the Shaykhayn112 says that the Prophet #1 said, "I
saw 'Amr bin 'Amir of Khuza'ah (i.e., 'Amr bin Luhaiy), dragging
his intestines in the Fire. He was the one who introduced idolworship." Ibn Ishaq113 has more details. Its words are: He was the
first person to alter the religion of Banu Isma il, place the idols and
give a start to various pagan rituals. Allah (Ag) expressed His
disapproval in several passages of the Qur'an. In one place He said:

"Do not utter what comes to your mouth saying, 'Tins is lawful
and this is unlawful,' to fasten lies upon Allah."114
Ibn 'Abbas 4 has said,115 "If you wish to know the Arab
condition before Islam, read from Verses 130 onwards of Surat AlAn'dm." Those passages give a fair idea of what the Arab
individuals and societies were like before the advent of Islam.
Nothing but traces of the religion of Ibrahim
had remained,
such as, reverence and circumambulation of the Ka'bah, Hajj,
'Umrah, stopping at 'Arafah and Muzdalifah, and sacrifice. Yet, in
all these rituals they had introduced innovations of all sorts. For
example, when Kinanah and Quraysh put on the pilgrim garb they
called out, "Here we are O our Lord. You have no partners except

those partners that You own and all that he owns.” Thus they first
declared God devoid of partners but immediately introduced their
deities as His subordinate partners. Similarly, although they
circumambulated the Ka'bah, they did it naked, and making noise
of all sorts.116
The Arabs had also constructed and adopted sacred houses
other than the Ka'bah. Those houses had their own custodians. They
also circumambulated them and offered them sacrifices. The
Quraysh themselves had one such house in Nakhlah called Al'Uzza. Its custodianship was in the hands of Banu Shayban of the
Sulaym tribe. They were allies of Banu Hashim. Similarly those of
Ta'if had Al-Lat whose keys were with Banu Mu'tab of the Thaqif
tribe. Aws and Khazraj, and those who followed their religion had
their own idol named Manat which was in Mushallal off Qudayd.
The Qur'an spoke of these deities when it said:

"Have you considered the Ldt and 'Uzza?-and the third, the
Manat?"117
Similarly the Daws, Khath'am, Bajilah, and those of the Arabs
of the Tabalah area had their own temple which housed DhulKhalasah deity. They called it Al-Ka bah Al-Yamaniyah while the

116 Ibn Ishaq without a chain-ftn Hisham (1/122). The report about the
introduction of pagan words into the Talbiyyah was reported by Bazzar
through Good (Hasan) chain. His words are: "Satans used to speak some
things to men.” He meant, turn away from submission to Allah until they
entered the pagan words in the Talbiyyah: "Here we are, O our Lord...
Here we are. You have not partners: except those partners that You own,
and all that he owns.” This remained until he drove them out of Islam
into paganism. See Kashful-Astar (2/15) about which Haythami said in AlMaima' (3/223): "Its narrators are those of the Sahih works. Shaykh
Tarhuni says (1/315/f.n. 194): "Its chain is of four narrators and has the
terms "from so-and-so” from Qatadah but one might ignore it m the light
of other supportive narratives. See the Talbiyyah of different tribes with
Ya'qubi, At-Tarikh (1/255-256).

Ka'bah at Makkah was called Al-Ka'bah Ash-Shamiyah. The Tay'
tribe and those around the Tay' mountains between Aja and Salma
had Fulus as their deity. Ri'am was the house for Himyar and the
Yemenites, while Rida' was for Banu Rabi ah bin Ka b. The Banu
Bakr and Taghlib, the sons of Wa'il and Iyad who lived in Sindad,
had their house called Dhul-Ka'bat.
Apart from these, there were plenty of other deities for other
tribes whose description fills history books.119
There are a few interesting stories in connection with the Arab
deities. For instance Sa'ib bin 'Abdullah had a stone that he himself
had carved in the shape of a deity. Apart from that, as he said, he
would make other deities out of a heap of dust. He would then pour
some good quality milk over it. But, there would come a dog, lick off
the milk and then raise its hind leg and urinate over it!120 It is also
reported that the Banu Hanifah had made a deity of wheat flour.
However, when they were struck with drought, they ate it up. There
are poetical pieces produced by other tribes that ridiculed Banu
Hanifah for dealing with their venerable deities in this shameful
manner.

121

Then there is the story of the poet who was inspired to say a
poetical piece when he found two foxes urinating on the idol he
worshipped.122 Indeed, we also have the story of 'Umar bin Khattab
who, out of his great hunger, ate off his idol made of dates.
Although not all these narrations are historically verifiable, but put
together they give some idea of what was happening around those
days.
Apart from idols, the worship of planets and stars was also

llsWe shall deal in detail about the destruction of these houses of worship
after the fall of Makkah. See the references there.

work Al-Asnam. However, all the chains are Weak (Da'if.)

introduced among the Arabs, especially in Haran, Bahrain and
Badiyah areas. The story goes that there used to be a man in Makkah
called Abu Kabshah who was devoted to the worship of a star called
Ash-Shi'ra. He invited the Makkans also to its worship and some of
the tribes such as Quraysh, Lakhm and Khuza'ah readily
responded. When the Prophet
appeared with a new religion,
they named him Ibn Abu Kabshah123 because he too was opposed to
the worship of their deities as Abu Kabshah was opposed to their
worship.
In Yemen Sun's worship was strong. Hence Allah's Words

"I have found a woman ruling over them. She has been given
everything and possesses a huge throne. I found them prostrating
themselves to the Sun instead of Allah. Satan has enamored for
them their deeds and has blocked their path so that they cannot be
guided.''124
Some of the Persian Magians and Zoroastrians had also
penetrated into the Arab world. Ibn Qutaybah writes: "Zoroastrian¬
ism was found among the members of Tamim, such as Zurarah and
Hajib bin Zurarah. A few free-thinkers were also to be found among
the Quraysh. They had imported the ideas from Hirah." Aqra' bin
Habis and Abu Sud, who was the grandfather of Waki' bin Hassan,
were close to the Magian religion.125 It had also reached Hijr1-6
migrating from Bahrain. They believed that killing an enemy on
1 97
their lands rendered it unclean for them.

valleys of Qura, in Fadak and Tayma.128 It seemed to be heading for
prominence with the penetration of the Jews into other parts of the
Peninsula and sliding down to the Yemen. Dhu Nuwas of Himyar
had adopted the faith and had tried to forcibly convert the
Christians of the area into Judaism. Judaism was also to be found
among the Banu Kinanah, Banu Harith bin Ka'b and Kindah. It
seems to have reached them via the Jews of Yathrib and Khayber.
On the other hand, Christianity had found its way among the
Ghassanians and Mundhirs. The best known churches in Hirah
were Hindul-Aqdam, Al-Lajj, and Harah Maryam.130 It had spread
into the south of the Peninsula, followed by the construction of
churches in Zafar and Aden.131 They were in large numbers in
Najran. The story of their encounter with the Prophet
in Makkah
and Madinah follows later in this work.
Some of the Quraysh tribes were also influenced by Christian¬
ity. Banu Asad bin 'Abdul-'Uzza, Banu Imra'ul-Qays of Tamim,
Banu Taghlib of the Rabi'ah group and some of the Quda'ah had
also adopted Christianity having been influenced by the Romans.132
Of those important figures that had adopted Christianity, one was
'Adi bin Hatim Ta'i.133
Nonetheless, the Judaic and Christian religions did not take
deep roots in the Arab society nor did they spread far and wide.
This can be noticed from the history of individuals and tribes. The
monotheism introduced by Ibrahim HtM also did not die out
completely. A few adhered strongly to it, dissatisfied with idolworship. They were known as the Hanafis or Hunafa. They believed

campaigns and his policy towards the Jews in these areas.

Of such Hunafa, Qus bin Sa'idah Iyadi, Zayd bin 'Amr bin

Sinan, Nabighah Dhubyani, Zuhayr bin Abu Salma, and Ka'b bin

named.13’
They were named Hunafa after the religion of Ibrahim ,%£:. The

In what follows we present short biographical sketches of these
Hunafa, shedding light on their faith and beliefs.

1. Zayd bin ‘Amr bin Nufayl
Ibn Ishaq139 has reported through Asma' bint Abu Bakr
who
said, "I have witnessed Zayd bin 'Amr bin Nufayl resting on the
wall of the Ka'bah saying, 'O Quraysh. By Him in Whose Hand is
Zayd's life, there is none left among you on the religion of Ibrahim
except me.' Then he would say, 'O Lord, if I knew a better manner of
worshipping You, I'd do it. But, alas, I don t know. Then he would
prostrate himself on his ride, and praying towards the Ka'bah
would add, 'My Lord is the Lord of Ibrahim, and my religion is the
religion of Ibrahim.' He would buy off a female infant condemned
to be buried alive, saying to the man intending to kill her, 'Don t kill
her. Give her to me I shall look after her. Then, when she comes of
age, take her back, or leave her to me.'"
Bukhari140 reports through Ibn 'Umar ^ that Zayd bin Amr
bin Nufayl traveled to Sham, looking for the true religion that he
could follow. He met a rabbi there and asked him about his religion.
The Jew told him, "You cannot adopt my religion without also
accepting your share of God's anger." Nufayl replied, "Am I not
trying to escape God's anger?" The Jew told him, "In that case, you
better be a Hanif." Zayd asked him, "What is being a Hanip” He
replied, "It is the religion of Ibrahim who was neither a Jew nor
Christian and did not worship any but Allah." Later he met a
Christian priest and the same conversation transpired between
them. When Zayd found that both had the same tiring to say about
the religion of Ibrahim, he left Sham When he came out, he raised
his hands and said, "O my Lord. Bear witness that I am on the
religion of Ibrahim."

139 Ibn Kathir quoted it in Al-Biddyah wan-Nihayah (2/258), through Good (Hasan)
chain. The first half is a narrative of Ibn Hishdm (1/287) up to the words, "then
he would prostrate on his ride" — through Good (Hasan) chain.
'40 Al-Fath (14/299-300/H. 3827).

Zayd would refuse to eat of the animal slaughtered by the
Quraysh, saying/ "1 am not going to eat out of what you sacrifice
at the alters. I do not eat of anything but that which is slaughtered
in the Name of Allah.” He ridiculed the Quraysh over their
sacrifices. He would say, "Allah created the sheep. It is He Who
sent down the water for it from the heavens, grew grass for it from
the earth, but thereafter you go and slaughter it in the name of
other than Allah?"
There are some other reports about him, but they are not very
authentic. However, they strengthen each other and reach an status.
They all lead to the same conclusion that Zayd was on the look out
for the true religion, and finally, decided on that of Ibrahim 8S&1.
That is why the Prophet ^ said, "He will be raised as a nation all by
himself between me and Jesus Christ the son of Maryam."141 He
also said, "When I entered into Paradise, I found two tall, thick trees
marked for Zayd bin 'Amr." Zayd had met the Prophet #§, but died
before the latter was commissioned the prophethood.142

2. Waraqah bin Nawfal

It is said that he went along with Zayd bin Nufayl looking for a
true religion to follow. His search led him to Christianity, although
his companion Zayd wouldn't agree to anything less than the
143
religion of Ibrahim $0,.

141 Ibn Kathir quoted it in Al-Bidayah (2/260-265) as transmission of 'Uthman
bin Abu Shaybah, remarking: "Its chain is Good & Perfect (jaiyid-Hasan).
Ibn Hajar said in Al-Fath, after quoting the Hadith in words, "He will be
raised on the Day of Standing as a nation all by himself," that it is
reported by Baghawi in As-Sahdbah as a report of Jabir with this addition.
Ibn Sa'd (1/161-162); and Tayalisi as arranged by Sa ati (2/161).
142Al-Bukhari/Al-Fath (14/298-299/H. 3826).
143 A report in Tayalisi — Banna's rearrangement (2/161), through a weak
chain for there falls in it Nufayl bin Hashim who was of unknown decent
(Majhul). None trusted it except Ibn Hibban. But there are supportive
narrations that strengthen it. So it rises to the level of Hasan li Ghayrihi. These
reports deal with Zayd's journey to Sham in search of the true religion.

The Prophet of Islam

60

One day the Prophet
told his wife Khadijah ^ in Makkah
that he had seen a light and that he feared that he might be out of his
mind. She consoled him and then took him to Waraqah and
explained all that had occurred. He said, "If you are true in what
you say, then this is the same messenger (Jibril) that had come down
to Musa. If you are commissioned and I am alive. I'll believe in you
and aid you."144 We shall have more to say of this conversation a
little later. Waraqah also said a few nice lines of poetry on the
concept of One God and life after death.143

3. Qus bin Sa‘idah Iyadi

'Ubadah bin Samit
and others have narrated that when the
Iyad delegation came up to Madinah, the Prophet
inquired about
Qus bin Sa'idah. He was told that he had died. The Prophet
said,
"I saw him once in the 'Ukaz fair on a red camel saying some nice
things that I can't recall now." One of the delegates said that he
remembered the words. They were: "People, come together.
Everyone who had to die has died. Everything that has to be, will
be. Dark night, the heavens of the zodiac sign, the roaring ocean, the
shining stars, the pitched mountains, the running streams. Surely, in
the heavens is a lesson. How's that? I see people going but not
returning. They seemed to have liked the staying and so have stayed
back. Or, is it possible that they gave up (the idea of coming) and
slept off? Qus swears by God: an oath doubtless. Surely, God has a
religion that is more pleasing to Him than yours." And then he
recited some poetry.146

144 Ahmad: Al-Fathur-Rabbani (20/207) through a Good (Hasan) chain: once
Disconnected (Mursal), and at another time Conneccted (Muttasil).
145 See Ibn Hishdm (1/294-295) being a narrative of Ibn Ishaq, without a chain,
and therefore Weak (Da'if).
146Ibn Kathir quoted it in Al-Bidayah wan-Nihayah (2/251-52) as a narrative of
Khara'iti, through a weak chain, for Nasr bin Hammad Warraq, better
known as Abu Harith Warraq was Da'if, useless man. See Al-Mughni (2/
779). Ibn Kathir remarked in Al-Bidayah that its chain is Unfamiliar
(Gharib).

61

Ibn 'Abbas ^.147 has a similar narration.
Ibn Kathir 4‘ has also presented several narrations about Qus's
belief in One God, his poetry and sayings lead us to believe that
there has to be a basis for all the reports that have been narrated
about him.149

4. Umaiyah bin Abu Salt

It is about this person Umaiyah bin Abu Salt that the Prophet j|§
had remarked, "Umaiyah was almost a Muslim."150 Another
version says, "Umaiyah's poetry was almost Muslim."151 He was
one of those who had adopted Christianity. His topics in poetry
were: Oneness of God and the concept of the Hereafter.152 He was a
leading poet153 and lived until the time the Prophet j||154 was
commissioned the prophethood. But he didn't believe in him out of
arrogance, unwilling to obey the Prophet j|§. It was about him that
Allah ($g) revealed the Verse:

147 Ibn Kathir quoted it in Al-Bidayah wan-Nihayah (2/251) as a report of
Tabarani; Bayhaqi also documented it in Ad-Dalail (1/104), but the chains
of both of them are very weak for there falls in them Muhammad bin
Hajjaj, whom Abu Hatim accused of lies, as also a few others, as in
Dhahabi's Al-Mughni (2/565).
148 Al-Bidayah (2/251-258) who commented: "...These weak reports strengthen
each other to prove that the story has a basis; then he mentioned
Bayhaqi's statement about this chain (p. 258).
149 Dala'il An-Nubuimvah (2/102-113) adding after quoting it through these
chains: "...These reports, although weak, strengthen each other to prove
that the story has a basis."

that it was in the second year.157 However we have some of his
poetical pieces on the battle of Badr.158

5. Labid bin Rabi‘ah ‘Amiri

He was a renowned poet of the pre-Islamic era. In fact, he was
one among the Mu'allaqat poets, meaning, those whose poetry was
hung on the door of the Ka'bah. The Prophet #! said, "The truest of
statements of Labid was: "Lo. Everything else apart from God is
false."159 One of his episodes involves 'Uthman bin Maz'un that we
shall narrate later. Labid had embraced Islam and died during the
caliphate of 'Uthman 4s, after having lived 150 years or more.160

Social Condition
By the very nature of things, the social life of a people is bound
closely with their religious beliefs and their economic system. Since
the religion of the Arabs was idol-worship, which is against human
nature, reason and logic, it had to give birth to a social system that
was primarily against the demands of human nature, reason and
logic.
In consequence, human society slides into debaucheries of all
sorts: drinking, gambling, unlimited spouses, infanticide from fear
of or as a result of poverty, killing of the female child for reasons of a
false sense of honor, eruption of wars for petty reasons, all leading
to a general anarchy. The Qur'an commented on these evils, as also

chroniclers or Hadith scholars , or historians. Shortly the Prophet's words

fighting these evils. Ibn 'Abbas 4 said, "If you wish to know the
state of the Arabs in pre-Islamic times, read Verses 130 onwards of
Surat Al-An'am." Allah (m) said:

Or:

“When one of them is given the glad tidings of the same thing as

he is trying hard to suppress his anger.''167
And:

“When one of them is given the glad tidings of a female child, his
face darkens and he tries hard to suppress his anger. He hides
himself from the people out of the evil he was told about. (He
considers:) should he accept her in shame, or should he bury her
in the earth? Lo! Evil is that which they judge.''168

Some of the marriage practices prevalent among the common
folk weren't very different from prostitution. Bukhari17“ and Abu
Dawud173 have preserved a report about this from 'Aishah 4>. She
said: "Four kinds of marriages were prevalent among the preIslamic Arabs. One of them was similar to the one now prevalent.
Another was lending of one's wife. In this system, a man had
intercourse with a woman who hadn't had sex with her husband
between two menstrual courses. Following that, the husband did
not go near her until he was sure whether she was pregnant from
the person she had sex with or not. Then there was the group
marriage in which a group of people, less than ten, assembled and
had sex with a woman. When she got pregnant and brought the
child, she sent for them and designated one of them as the child s
father. A fourth marriage was the one in which a woman hoisted a
flag on her house. A lot of people went and had sex with her. When
she brought a child, they hired a tracker who declared one of them
nearest in resemblance to the child as the child s father. When Islam
came, it declared all these practices as unacceptable except the first

one." Moreover, none of those who indulged in these practices felt
any shame. The Sahihayn174 have a report which says that a man got
up and proclaimed, "O Messenger of Allah. So-and-so is my son. I
had sex with his mother in pre-Islamic times." The Prophet
replied, "After Islam, such a claim is not valid. Pre-Islamic affairs
are behind us. (The rule now is that) the child belongs to the mother
and for the man exile."
A little later in this work we shall recount another story
involving Sa'd bin Abu Waqqas and 'Abd bin Zam'ah concerning a
son of Zam'ah's slave-girl.
In those days they took into marriage two real sisters at a time;
also marrying the wives of their fathers at their death or when they
divorced them. Hence Allah ($g) said:

"(It is forbidden) that you should keep together two sisters in
marriage, except for what has been (in the past)."1'5
And:

"Do not marry those your fathers married."1'6
Divorce also had no limit. They divorced any number of
times.177 Islam reduced it to two through the Qur'anic dictum:

i&a
"Divorce is only twice.”178

The Arabian Peninsula

Admittedly though, there were some good characteristics
among the Arabs and their societies, and a few bright spots despite
the above moral weaknesses. Those could be the reason why Allah
(M) chose them to bear the burden of His last Message to mankind.
One such factor is that, as against the case with many other peoples
of the world, their corrupt ways were not based in a complex
philosophy with deep roots in their souls that could not be
uprooted. Further, they w«re men of strong resolve who proved
true to their words once they had uttered them. The Qur an
mentions this in one passage. It says:
it*
S

f-p-' .✓'x

T.

-i

"Among the believers are men who proved true in what they had
promised Allah. So, there are some among them who have
fulfilled their obligation, while others are waiting. And they never
changed (their resolve)."179
There were many among them who bore good qualities and
appreciated those who bore good qualities. This is apparent from
their attitude towards the Prophet 0. We shall later mention the
story of Abu Sufyan's conversation with Heraclius to illustrate this
point.
Again, the minds of the Arabs of those times were like clean
slates: ready to receive and retain the right ideas. The mind s
freedom from ideas allowed for a powerful memory. We have Ibn
'Abdul-Barr reporting Ibn Shihab Zuhri's words, "I pass by the
(market) at BaqT and block my ears so that useless ideas do not
enter into my head. For, by Allah, nothing entered into my head that
I forgot" Ibn 'Abdul-Barr180 also wrote that there were some who
heard a poem only once but remembered it in full thereafter. It is
reported of Ibn 'Abbas'4 that he memorized the whole of a long
poem following a single hearing.

We are not surprised, therefore, by the number of traditions that
persons like Ibn 'Abbas, Abu Hurayrah, 'Aishah and Ibn Mas ud
have narrated.
Abu Hurayrah
for instance has five thousand, three hundred
and seventy-four Ahadith to his credit. Ibn 'Umar A narrated two
thousand six hundred and thirty Ahadith.

Another characteristic was that they greatly valued freedom and
independence. They would not bend down to anyone except thenleaders who commanded their respect by displaying the qualities that
they approved of, such as chivalry, patience and forbearance.
Moreover, despite their worship of idols, they did not deny
God's existence. The Qur'an said:
jU-

"Wlten they are asked, 'Who created the heavens and the earth,
and overpowered the sun and the moon?' Surely they will say,
'Allah.'"182
And:

"If you asked them, 'Who sends down water from the heavens
and quickens the earth after it was dead?' Surely, they will
answer, 'Allah.'"183
Another advantage they had was that they spoke a single
language: a language that was powerful and eloquent to magical
limits. It was capable of communicating in the most precise manner
ideas and concepts presented by Islam.

The Jews

Religious Life
Both the Jewish and Christian religions subjected their revealed
messages to alterations and interpolations.184 In consequence, they
lost the original spirit and never rose up to play a constructive role
in the removal of the corruption they had come to fight.
Judaism, which, aside from the corruptions it brought to
religious principles, claimed that it was a religion for the Jews alone.
Although they believed in the Oneness of God —a blessing
bestowed on them apart from others of the human race-they were
heavily influenced by the beliefs and practices of the pagans among
whom they lived, or were in their neighborhood, or who overcame
them. Fair-minded Jewish scholars have accepted this historical fact.
For example, the Jewish Encyclopedia tells us that the fact that the

of the previous revealed Scriptures. See in this regard the following books.

The Prophet of Islam

Jewish Prophets expressed their anger and frustration at their idolworship implies that it was fairly wide-spread among the Israelites
and that it could not be uprooted despite their exile to Babylonia.183
The Israelites seem to have also accepted polytheistic influences.
Talmud186 confirms that idol-worship was quite deep-rooted among
the Israelites.
In addition, the Torah and the Talmud are full of writings that
do not befit Allah, His Messengers, or Prophets. For example, one
finds in the Torah (the Old Testament) that after the act18' of
creation God felt tired and needed to rest on the seventh day. He
188
blessed this day because he quit all works and took complete rest.
Following this, the Jews do not work on Saturdays.
The Old Testament narrates the story of Adam and Eve
(Hawwa), on both be peace, that, "They heard the sound of the
Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day. The man and
his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God among
the trees of the garden. But the Lord God called to the man, and said
to him, 'Where are you?' And he said, 'I heard the sound of thee in
the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.'
He said, 'Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten of the
tree of which I commanded you not to eat?"' (Genesis, ch. 3)
The image of God thus presented is that of a human, who does
not even know what's happening in his backyard.18"1 To the above
the Torah adds that after Adam ate of the Tree of Knowledge, he

1X5 Same ref. as in (e) above, f.n. 202.
1X6 This is a compendium that aims at the instruction and training of the Jews
in their religion. It is a collection of books and commentaries on Mishna
(meaning Law) produced by Jewish scholars of past times. See At-Talmud:

1X7 See At-Tawrdtus-Sdmiriyyah, translated by Rabbi Samiri: Abul-Hasan Ishaq
Sury, a Darul-Ansar Egypt publication.
1X8 See Genesis, ch. 2.
1X9 See Genesis, ch. 3. Compare this with the Islamic concept expressed in the
Words of Allah: "You are not in an affair, and you do not recite the Qur'an,
nor do you do a deed, but We are witness over you when you indulge in it."
(Surat Yunus: 61). And: "Surely, We have created man and know what passes
in his heart and We are nearer to him than his jugular vein.” (Surat Qaf. 16)

rose up to the Divine level because of his sinful act. He acquired
knowledge of good and evil, despite the fact that when He created
him. His Lord had wished that he should remain ignorant. The
Lord, in fact, pushed him out of Paradise because he feared that
Adam would rise in power and one day he and his wife would eat
of the Tree of Eternity and remain in Paradise forever.190 Further,
God was surprised by the corrupt behavior of the humans on earth
and regretted that He had created them at all.191
Similarly God is shown in their Books as regretting the Flood
that drowned everybody.192 It is also alleged that He accepted to be
a guest of Ibrahim
and went to his house, in the company of two
193
angels, to enjoy a meal.
Again, the corrupted Torah portrays God as entering into a
wrestling bout with His Messenger and slave Ya'qub (Jacob). The
match lasts the whole of a night. When it became clear that Ya'qub
would emerge victorious, God was forced to play a trick on him. He
broke his thigh bone to disable him. Nevertheless, Ya'qub would not
let God go before he had extracted from Him "the blessing" and the
title "Israel."194
God, as portrayed in the Torah, is exclusively the God of the
Israelites. They are a chosen people and the others are not beloved.
Non-Jews are like cattle about whom God is not concerned.195
Accordingly, the Israelites cultivate among themselves a hatred for
the rest of the people, especially the Arabs. This factor is the
foundation stone of their religion. Accordingly, one finds in the
Torah Prophet Nuh <m depicted as getting drunk and lying flat
disclosing his private parts. When his son Ham, the progenitor of
the Kan'an (Canaan) tribes, happened to spot him in that state he
had a good laugh and dishonored his father before his other sons
Shem (Sam) and Japheth (Yafith). They saw him too in that state, but

190 Genesis, ch. 3.

195 Genesis, ch. 6; 7.

72

not his private parts. When Nuh came to himself and came to know
of what had happened, he cursed Ham. In the words of the Torah,
he said, “Cursed be Canaan; a slave of slaves shall he be to his
brothers." He also said, “Blessed by the Lord my God be Shem; and
let Canaan be his slave/'196
The apparent objective of the story is to put the sons of Ham —
the Canaanites — to disgrace, although in no way they sinned in this
incident. The story also aims at glorifying the Israelites, the sons of
Shem.
Similarly, the Jews portray another Prophet, Lut, as getting
drunk and committing fornication with his own two daughters,
who got pregnant by him. They claim that the Mo'abites are the sons
of Mo'ab, one of those daughters.197 The objective was once again to
disgrace their enemies, the Mo'abites. All this was done in the name
of revelation.

"Woe then unto those who write the book with their hands and
then say, 'This is from Allah,' in order to purchase a paltry price
thereof. Woe then unto them for what their hands wrote and woe
unto them for what they earned."199
The Torah also gives to understand that all non-Israeli women
are prostitutes and their men Goyem200 who can be killed with
complete impunity. Whoever kills a non-Jew in effect offers a
sacrifice to God.201
Could such a book be called a Holy Revelation of God which
guides the people to righteousness and piety?
It is these kinds of beliefs that have rendered the Jews arrogant
towards every noble value, while they freely pursue their worldly
objectives. An example is the "Protocol" worked out by the Zionists.
To achieve their objectives, they do not hesitate from slandering the
Prophets too. They portray Ibrahim m\ as a greedy man of the
world. They pass the story that he sent his wife to Fir'awn and asked
her to pretend to him that she was his sister in order to get some
sheep and donkey from him. The Torah reports him as saying to her
that she should say she is his sister since it was good for Abraham
(Ibrahim) to protect his own life.
Similarly,

Messengership from his elder brother by a cunning trick. Most
strangely,203 they present one of Ya'qub's daughters, Dina, as a

whom his mother carried after her evil act with a soldier called
Bandara. Jesus himself is portrayed as a liar, mad, misguided.

magician, trickster and pagan. The Talmud regards the Christians as
no better than a piece of bloodied cloth thrown away by a woman in
her periods. They are referred to as pagans, murderers, corrupt,
animals, filthy, donkeys, pigs and dogs.211
The Torah also reports Prophet Dawud >&y (David) committing
sin with the wife of one of his soldiers and making her pregnant. This
happened when he saw her on the roof of her house. Dawud is said to
have promptly dispatched her husband to the most dangerous spot on
the battlefront in order to get him killed and then marry his widow.21*1
Can a Prophet possibly commit such things and yet be a guide
unto mankind?
The Qur'an took up many of these perversions for questioning,
and criticized the contents of their holy books. For example,
speaking of their inclination to idol-worship, despite the fact that
Musa
(Moses) was still among them, it said:

"(They said), 'Appoint for us an idol, as the others have their
idols/"207

was absent for a while, they were told by
Harun

"And surely, Musa came to you with clear signs, but you took

"Show us Allah, clearly."210
And, acting arrogant against Allah, they said as is shown in

It also said:

"Why then did you murder Allah's Prophets, if you were
believersl"217
The above quotations from the Noble Qur'an, and those from
the holy literatures of the Jews, provide sufficient proof of the
corruptions and perversions into which the Jews had fallen.

Socio-Political Life
Allah {M) never meant to send down a religion that completely
lacked humanism. The Jews completely disfigured their religion to
make it one that had no aspect of mercy in it for the humankind,
fastening upon the Prophets of God such low qualities as unbefitting
ordinary men. No wonder that they have remained at war with the
non-Jews to this day.
In the seventh century we find that they engineered a clash
between the Christians and the Persians in Antioch resulting in a
slaughter of the Christians. Similarly they aided the Persians in the
persecution of the Christians in Sham, murdering by their own
hands a large number of them in Sur. It was right then that the
Roman emperor Heraclius took revenge on them when he learnt of
their role in the slaughter of the Christians.218
We find the Qur'an, therefore, describing very accurately their
situation in the sixth and seventh centuries of the Christian era, and
the perversion of their behavior and attitude, individually as well as
collectively, rendering them unfit for the moral leadership of the
world. Allah said:

their deceptive hand on the Muslims quite too often, until on Allah's

following up his instructions, 'Umar

expelled them out of the

Arabian Peninsula. That was the only way of doing away with their
mischief and conspiracies.

The Christians

Religious Life
Apart from suffering interpolations and alterations at the hands
of its adherents, Christianity was subjected to other kinds of
corruption.221 One was incorporation of pagan, Greek and Roman

219 Surat Al 'Imran: 75.
220 See the following works for details of their attitude towards Islam: The
Qur'an and its commentaries, such as of Surat Al-Baqarah: 40-44 and what
follows. Sirat Ibn Ishaq, 'Uyunul-Athar ft Fununil-Maghazi ivas-Siyar by Ibn
Sayyidin-Nas, Fiqhus-Siratin-Nabawiyyah Muhammad Ghazali, Fiqhus-Sira¬
tin-Nabawiyyah by Dr. Muhammad Sa'eed Ramadan Buti, etc.
221 Dr. Muhammad Abu Ghayt took up the study of the history of the four
approved Gospels: Matthew, Marks, Luke and John. He writes: "In what
has preceded, we have presented the history of the Gospels as accepted by
the Christians, and the extent to which they can be attributed to the
authors attributed to them. We have pointed out that, e.g., there is no
relationship between Matthew and the present-day Gospel, for his name
was entered in the Greek version translated from the Hebrew and that we
could not establish, as the Bible critics have not been able to establish
whether the translator added fresh material as his own notes and
explanations or whether he was honest in his work of translation.
Further, the absence of the original after the appearance of the translation

superstitions. It led to a dilution of the teachings of Christ. Over
time, it led to the transformation of their religion into one burdened
with pagan ideas. Its marked characteristic was that it acted as a
barrier between human beings on the one side and reason, logic and
knowledge, on the other. Rev. James Houston Baxter222 expressed it
lucidly and accurately when he said, in effect, "Paganism had been
routed, but not extinguished. Rather, it possessed a passionate
corner in the hearts/ and its practices manifested in the garb of
Christianity. Those who gave up the idols, took a few of them into
Christianity in the name of Martyrs attributing them with the

and the concealment of the name of the translator reduces the weight very
much. It seems the translator was one of the students of Matthew.
It is also established that Marks was not one of the Apostles that he took
his Gospel from his master Peter; that the Gospel of Luke was not meant
to be an epistle of authority. It was largely composed of events and
occurrences that he learnt from others. It is not free of errors but rather is
mixed with interpolations that need a set of principles to get rid of. It is
another thing that Luke was not one of the Apostles but rather a student
of Paul who is known as the first corrupter of the Christian religion.
It is also clearly established that it is highly doubtful that the Gospel of
John as attributed to him is truly his. It can be assumed that whoever did
it, introduced Hellenistic thoughts into it.
It has also been said that the Apostles of Jesus Christ did not understand
but through metaphors and similitudes. Hence, his extensive use of these
modes of speech. When we take into consideration all these facts, it is not
difficult to conclude that these Gospels are as far from being revealed as
the heaven is from the earth. We might add that the present-day Gospels
are only related to the Gospel of Jesus Christ by a thread thinner than that
of a spider's thread. It is but a few phrases, spread here and there, that
can be related to the Noble Qu'ran and which can be said to be evidences
in favor of the Prophet Muhammad jg.
Ibn Hazm has in his work Al-Milal ivan-Nihal, listed the various
contradictions that exist between the four Gospels, and between them and
the Torah, that cannot be resolved."

religions, see Tarikh Ibn Bitriq, Anwarul-]alil fi Akhbdr Misr by Rifa'ah

attributions of divinity. In the next step they carved their statues. In
this manner the idol-worship of the past was imported into
Christianity under new names and new garb. This is how the
worship of the saints and martyrs was incorporated into Christian¬
ity. The belief that came along was that since these figures had some
of the attributes of divinity in them, they could be resorted to for
intercession and used as intermediary figures between God and
man. Thus, the names changed, realities did not. It came to such a
pass that by 400 AC, the yearly festival day of the Sun-God was
converted into Christ's birthday." (History of Christianity in the Light

of Modern Knowledge, Glasgow, 1926. p. 4070).
What Abu Ghayt has to say about Christian paganism ends on
the following note: "During the days of oppression, idol-worship
remained raising and lowering its flag, following the efforts of the
Christian priestly class to appease the Roman emperors who
persisted in their desires that their statues be revered. Anyone
who opposed their desires was persecuted and faced burning on the
stake and destruction of property. Christian history is full of such
stories. Finally, after a long struggle, Christianity bowed to the
Roman pressure as well as the pressures from those who had
converted to the Christian faith, but showed no inclination to give
up the idols the Christians had inherited from their forefathers."
In addition, Christians introduced priesthood into their religion,
and interpolated into the New Testament what no man of sound
mind would accept. Ibn Hazm for instance, one of those who took
up a comparative study, reached astonishing conclusions when he
studied Christianity from its sources and debated with

the

Christians. He wrote: "The Jacobites amongst the Christians claim
that Jesus was God himself who was crucified and had died on the
cross. They said the world remained without God for three days,
until He arose and returned to His Throne. Thus, God, though
eternal, became the created in Mary's womb. This is what the
Qur'an criticized about Christian beliefs (in Surat Al-Maidah: 72):

"Surely, those people committed disbelief who said that Jesus
Christ is God."

And (in Verse 73 of the same):

i

¥

"They said, 'Allah is the third of the three.”
And, Allah said reporting the words of 'Isa on the Day of
Judgement (in the same Surah, Verse 116):

"Did you tell the people, 'Declare both me and my mother gods
besides Allah?”'
If not for these statements in the Qur'an, no Muslim would dare
repeat what the Christians claim as their beliefs. By Allah, if we
hadn't met the Christians, we wouldn't have believed that there can
be people so far removed from reason and logic." Ibn Hazm follows
up with the words, "We wish these people could tell us who ruled
the heavens and the earth during the three days when God was
dead. We might also ask these people who claim that the Lord is
composed of three elements: the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost,
if the three are in one, co-equal, then why did you have to name
them the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost? Is not in this scheme
the Father Himself the Son, the Son the Father etc.? The Gospel
refutes their belief that they are co-equal. It reports Christ as having
said that on the Judgement Day he will occupy a position on the
right hand side of God. But they contradict themselves by saying
that no one but the Father knows when the Day of Judgement will
be called. It is clear that the Father is not the Son and vice versa. And
if the three are different, which is something the Christians don't
accept, then surely, each has to be lesser than the others in Attributes
and Qualities. Obviously any Quality that suffers diminution cannot
be eternal."223
As for the Christian belief in the truth of the Gospels, Ibn Hazm
summarized the objections in the following words: "The following

are seventy instance of forgeries, misstatements and contradictions
in the Gospels that cannot be resolved. Some of these forgeries are
composed of three forgeries or less.
“For instance, sometimes the texts claim that Jesus was God s
son, at other times that he was Joseph's son, and at another time he
was David's son and, finally, son of a man. At some places they say
he was God who creates and nourishes, at another place it is stated
he is God's lamb. On another occasion it is said that he is God with
God within him. Yet, he is ''in'' his disciples or the disciples are ''in''
him. He is also God's Knowledge and His Power. In other places it
is stated that he does not judge anyone and does not execute His
will. In some places he is a Prophet and a slave of Allah. On one
occasion, God surrendered him to his enemies. Yet, he is also
portrayed as one who was bestowed the Kingdom of God so that he
could decide on the lawful and unlawful. Yet the same Jesus also
suffered pangs of hunger asking to be fed. He felt thirsty and drank
water. He sweated from fear and cursed a fig tree for not finding a
fruit on it. Then he was arrested, slapped and hit on the head, spat in
the face, whipped on the back, taken to the cross, made to drink
vinegar and was finally crucified between two thieves on a cross
with his hands nailed to it. When dead, he was buried, but after an
interval he arose. Interestingly, when given a new life, his first and
most important concern when he met with his disciples was food.
He demanded to be fed. They offered him bread and fried fish,
topping it with honey. After that he attended his affairs..."
After writing the above, Ibn Hazm lists down the lies,
blasphemies and slanders which were introduced into (holy) books
other than the Gospels.
Surely, when Judaism and Christianity stooped to this level,
humanity stood in the need of a new Messenger. So, Muhammad
the son of 'Abdullah, was sent down to rescue the humanity and
•

establish a religion which the world was glad to receive.

Socio-Political Life
The seventh century dawned to witness wars between the
Christians of Sham under the tutelage of the Roman empire, and the
Christians of Egypt. The cause was the disagreement over the nature
of Jesus Christ. The former were known as Malachias while the
latter as Minophites.
The Malachias (Malkaniyah) believed in the dual nature of Jesus
Christ while the Minophites (Minofisiyah) believed in a single
nature. Thus the Christian world was engaged in a struggle with its
own community, instead of attending to the corruption in the world
and inviting the people to the truth.225 The Copts of Egypt were
subjected to persecution at the hands of those of the Christians who
lived in the territories of the Roman Empire. On the eastern front,
people faced such hardships that they preferred to live under
foreign rule and rebellions ensued. In the year 532 CE, it is said that
some 30,000 people were killed in Constantinople alone.226 They
went to the extremes in resorting to ways of torture.
In the Byzantine Egypt a reign of religious persecution and
political persecution brought about suffering, oppression and
hunger in a land which they milked but forgot to feed. The people
were only relieved of their suffering by the arrival of the Muslim
armies, as acknowledged by the Christians themselves, such as
Gustave Le Bon.228
In Sham, the Byzantines overburdened the people with taxes to
the extent that they were forced to sell their houses to pay back loans.229
As for northern and western Europe, they faced permanent
state of wars and lived under complete darkness of high ignorance.

The Magians
Religious Life
Before the appearance of Zoroaster,231 Iran had known the faith
of a trinity comprised of Mithra, Yeyma, and Asha. The faith
continued to command its influence even after the appearance of
Zoroastrian religion which was strongly influenced by the older
religion. In this system certain natural objects were held sacred, such
as fire and stars. Deities of several kinds were also objects of
worship.
Initially, Zoroastrianism stood against the religion of Mithra,
Yeyma and Asha. It invited the people to the worship of one God
and to eschew idols of stone. It tried to do away with the worship of
stars and other celestial objects. Nevertheless it allowed holy
functions to the sun and fire in the new religion since the two
symbolized power and never ceased to radiate light and mercy.
They helped man against his adversaries.232 Zoroastrianism also
allowed sanctity of dust, water and air for their important role in the
life of the humans.

Haydtuhu wa Falsafatuhu: Hamid 'Abdul-Qadir, book no. 1, Maktabah
Nahda, Egypt, 1375. The sum and substances stated there is that originally
Zoroastrianism was not paganism. It was a doctrine based on belief in
One God, denial of Satan, and faith in Rewards and Punishments. It
invited to the virtuous and prohibited vice. (See the 13th chapter AlDiyanatuz-Zaradashtiyyah, pp. 79-110. See also Tabari: At-Tarikh (1/540561).

After Zoroaster's death the Magian sect rose up in power.233
This sect worshipped fire and considered it a god. Its followers used
it in all religious functions symbolizing it as one that stood for the
weak. They finally came to be identified as the worshippers of fire.
They were also referred to as the Magian monks. Of the rituals that
prevailed were idol-worship and holy sacrifices, especially for
Mithra god who happened to be the most dominant deity. These
had their long historical record that went beyond Zoroaster.
When Alexander the Macedonian invaded Persia at the end of
the fourth century before Christ, the Zoroastrians disappeared from
view. They appeared again after five centuries. It was after the
Sassanid empire had been established that Zoroastrianism reap¬
peared as a Persian heritage. This Zoroastrianism however was far
removed from the Zoroastrianism of the pre-Sassanid era. It was
merely a convenient tool used by the rulers and the priestly class to
oppress the people.234
In the third century before Christ there appeared a man called
Manes (Mani) who laid the foundations of a new religion. It was an
admixture of Zoroastrianism, Christianity and Desonian religions.235
The Zoroastrian priestly class denounced this man because his
religion was idol-worship, pure and simple. The new religion claimed
that the creator had a dual existence. Or, there were two sourceslight and darkness — that were the origins of this world. One
symbolized everything good and the other, everything evil. Each
had its own sphere of influence. It was these two powers that
combined together to create the world and everything that it has.236
They believed that whoever attempted to adulterate darkness with
light committed evil. For example, marriage was an evil. It was better

233 Although both commonly treated as one, 'Abdul-Qadir treats them
different, see pp. 115-118.,
234 See Arthur Kristensen: Iran fi 'Ahdis-Sdsaniyyin, translated by Yahya
Khashshab, pp. 19-29; and Dr. Ahmad Shalabi: Al-Islam Silsilah Muqaranatul-Adyan, no. 3, p. 41-42.
235 It is attributed to Ibn Disan who laid its foundations.

to remain single and cut off the human race of the sources of new
supply, to destroy the race, so that only light prevailed in the end.
In the year 276 CE, the Persian king Bahram bin Hurmuz killed
Mani saying, "This man sought the destruction of the world, and so
deserves to be destroyed himself."
Yet, despite this sacrifice, Manicheans remained a strong
underground force. It remained so until the advent of Islam.
Then appeared Mazdaists (Mazdakists) in the fifth century who
gave a new life to Manicheans and who taught that women and
wealth were public property.
A Persian king called Qabbaz adopted Mazdak's ideas and tried
to apply them to the Persian society during the first ten years of his
rule. However, when he realized the fallacy, he beheaded Mazdaks in
the year 529 CE, and persecuted his followers. They went into hiding
during the Sassanian period to reappear just before Islam's advent.
Another religion that appeared in Iran was Mercurism
(Marquniyyah), named on its founder Mercureus. They also
believed in a dualism in which light was the creator of good and
darkness the creator of evil.237 They accepted the influences of
Zoroastrianism as well as Christianity.
Desonia (Disaniyyah) was yet another religion to appear in
Persia. This too was the religion of dualism. Upon the ideas of the
Mercurians, it added a third reality which was the dividing line
between light and darkness, although it could not explain this third
reality satisfactorily. Ibn Disan is said to be the first person who
presented the idea of God's incarnation, claiming that God's light
had dissolved into his heart.

Socio-Political Life
The religious systems set up by the pre-Zoroastrian pagan
religions spread a lot of corruption in the Persian land. The
countryside people in particular suffered a great deal of oppression
ranging from loss of wealth to life.239
Zoroastrianism tried to improve the situation. But once
Manichean and Mazdaist religions stepped in, the situation
worsened.
Under the Magian religion, which was an offshoot of
Zoroastrianism, as under Manicheanism and Mazdaism, and a
few other minor religions, moral anarchy set in among the Persians.
It was accompanied by internal violence as well as external wars.
During those ongoing wars, whenever the Roman Christians were
defeated, the worshippers of Fire looted their wealth and enslaved a
large number of them. In turn, when the Persians were defeated,
they suffered the same fate.240
The Persian Magians neither worshipped one God nor
possessed any moral values. They freely slit the throats of the
breakaway groups, whenever they got the better of them.
One of the widely prevalent practices among the Zoroastrian
societies was incest. They used to say, "The son is nearest to be able
to satisfy the desires of his mother. Therefore, if a man dies, his son
has the first right to the widow."-41 Yezdgird the Second, who ruled
during the middle of the fifth Christian century, married his own
daughter. But later he killed her. Similarly, Bahram bin Jubian, a
&

...

sixth century ruler, married his own sister.

everyone else a free reign in expressing their base desires, which

was the cause of their gradual destruction. Furthermore the evil
influences of the ruling families worsened the situation. Iran sank in
moral depravity.243
The Persians looked at the saintly families, as well as the nobles
of the society, as rationalists par excellence. They believed they were
above the common lot and enjoyed natural superiority over
everyone else in intellectual capacities. They accorded them
unlimited powers and submitted to them completely.244
The Persian masses were divided into classes, and each class
had a given role to play in society.
Further, the Persians exaggerated the achievements of their
nation and thought that they were above the rest of the peoples of
the world and that God had bestowed them with special qualities,
according to them a special rank above the rest. This led them to
look down upon other nations as inferiors and referring to them by
nicknames that speak of their derogatory attitude towards them.'4’’
Since Fire could not send them down revelations containing any
law, or send any kind of messengers, or interfere in their daily lives,
or punish the defaulters, the Magian religion became no more than a
set of rituals. They practiced rituals that had to be performed at
specific hours at specific places. But, outside the places of worship,
i.e., in the streets, in their everyday lives, in economy or politics, it
had no function whatsoever. They were free to live their lives the
way they thought fit, just in the manner of the pagans of all times.246
The Persians were thus denied, under the Magians, a sound
comprehensive religion: one that could lead them to a decent and

virtuous life or offer a complete system of life that guided in every
affair of life both at the social, as well as at the political level. They
missed a religion that could act as a barrier between oppression and
the oppressors.24' This is something the Persians experienced only
under Islamic rule.
Further, they were denied good rulers. In fact, they were ruled
by people who were themselves the source of many corrupt
practices. Sometimes the rulers became deities when they found that
the people had not one God to worship and obey. They struggled
amongst themselves for power to the extent that once six rulers
changed places on the throne within the span of one month. The
throne lost its dignity. Wealth and property of the land became the
ownership of anyone who occupied the throne. It helped him lead a
luxuriant life filled with vulgarities of all sorts. For example, when
the last emperor Yezdgird fled from the Islamic armies, he had with
him a thousand cooks, a thousand singers, a thousand caretakers for
the tigers, a thousand caretakers for the flacons and other retinue.
Yet he considered himself a refugee in troubled times and thought
that his lack of proper retinue and means of luxury was
lamentable.248 At the same time the common people led a life of
poverty and misery overburdened by taxes and war costs.

The Chinese
Religious Life
In the sixth century after Christ, the Chinese largely followed
one of the three religions: The Lao-tzu religion,

Confucianism and

Buddhism. The first of these was paganism pure and simple. It was

an ideology rather than a practical religion. Its adherents led an
ascetic life. Not surprisingly, most of its followers gradually gave up
the religion.
Confucianism, on the other hand, was more practical than
theoretical. However, its teachings were confined to the worldly
affairs alone. Its followers, at least in certain eras, did not think
that a particular god was to be worshipped. They worshipped
whatever they liked: trees, rivers, etc.251 They built temples for
Confucius, offered sacrifices at his altar and prostrated themselves
before it.
A little before Islam, the worship of spirits of the ancestors
became prevalent. They believed that the spirits of their ancestors
abided with them.
The Chinese version of Buddhism lost its originality altogether
after the Brahmans turned it into a religion of idol-worship. Temples
were built for Buddha's statues that the common folk worshipped.
These idols dominated the entire religious and social life during the
golden Buddhist era. Sorcery and superstition also penetrated deep
in the lives of the Buddhists. After remaining a force for a thousand
years. Buddhism began to decline.252

Social Life
Confucianism did not possess the light of faith that could
give spiritual satisfaction, nor a revealed Law to solve the day-today problems of life. It was a package of wise sayings and
experiences of past devotees that a man could profit from if he
wished or reject if he wished. This lack of guidance resulted in
the glorification of the male, as was the case among the preIslamic Arabs. When they had a male child they hung bows and
arrows at the entrance to their house as a sign of the arrival of a
male protector of the family. If it was a female, they hung a

spinning spindle, a sign of weakness.
During the times of the Chinese version of Buddhism, the
governments took charge of performing the rituals and worship of
the idols. The society lost the brotherhood of Buddhist concept, and
innovations of various sorts appeared. Confucianism could not
prevent, nor was it opposed to, the appearance of castes and classes.
But, admittedly, the system was less restrictive, and less over¬
burdening than the Indian Brahminism which dominated the Indian
scene.

The Indians
Religious Life
It was Brahminism that dominated the Indian subcontinent. It
granted divinity to every supernatural power. People made idols
and believed that some of those deities resided in them. Thus they
ended up worshiping the idols. And the idols increased in numbers.
At the intellectual level, their religious philosophy evolved into that
of three gods: Brahma, Shiva and Vishnu.
After Brahminism, Buddhism prospered. This religion did not
endeavor to solve the metaphysical riddles. It tried to reform the
human society. This it did by dictating abstinence in order to kill
carnal desires.254
Nevertheless, with the passage of time Buddha's teachings were
overtaken by philosophical thoughts, until it became a package of
metaphysical ideas beyond comprehension. Thus, Buddhism suf-

92

fered the same fate as Brahminism. In time it became difficult to
distinguish between the two. In fact, it would be right to say that
Brahminism devoured Buddhism.
In the upshot, idol-worship became the religion of the Indians.
There were all kinds and classes of them. Some idols were historical
figures, others heroes in whom gods resided. There were mountains
on which they thought gods squatted. There was gold and silver
through which also gods were believed to have manifested
themselves. River Ganges was another deity. Weapons of war,
reproductive organs, some animals, such as the cow, plants and
stars, became deities.

Social Life
Historians agree that the worst of periods in human history
from the point of view of social, religious and moral degeneration
begins with the beginning of the sixth century after Christ. On the
Indian scene, various corruptions found their way into places of
worship. Some men worshipped naked women while women
worshipped naked men. Women became a commodity of no
value. A man would lose his mother in gambling. A woman was
not to remarry after the death of her husband. Some orphans
were burned to death at the death of their mothers. This was in
practice in the upper castes and women were reduced to slavery.
The religious philosophy divided the people into four castes: (i)
Brahmans: the priestly class, (ii) Kshatriyas: the soldier class, (iii)
Vaisyas: the trader and farmer class and (iv) Sudras: the lower class
that serves the upper three castes.
The last mentioned class was considered unclean. Its members
were not to intermingle with others, and were kept apart to the
extent that they were not to know the holy literature.255 Tire penalty
for killing a dog, a cat, a frog, a raven or an owl was the same as

killing a Sudra. The Brahmans occupied the topmost position and
were above the law. Destruction of other people's life and property
was lawful to them.256
Obviously, the widely prevalent degeneration, whether it be
among Arabs or non-Arabs, demanded that a new Messenger be
raised. Allah sent Muhammad «|| to the whole of the mankind,
Arabs as well as non-Arabs, to rescue them from the oppression of
life and societies and bring them out of darknesses into light.

lineage to this extent, and it has the consensus of the scholars in its
favour.2 But thereafter there are wide speculations,3 4 that is, from

Allah (51) willed that he should be bom among the best of the
tribes on earth and of the best of lineage. The Prophet
himself
said, "Of the descendants of Isma'il, Allah (51) chose Kinanah. Of
the Kinanah, He chose Quraysh. Of the Quraysh He chose Hashim;
and chose me from the descendants of Hashim."8 He also said, "The
day Allah created the creation. He placed me among the best of
them. Then, as He divided them. He placed me again among the
best of them. Subsequently, as He divided them into tribes. He
placed me among the best of tribes. Finally, when He made families.
He placed me among the best of families. So, I am the best of them in
lineage, and the best of them among the families."9

was of the best of families. He said, "He is
of the best of lineage amongst us."10
It was his grandfather 'Abdul-Muttalib who named him
Muhammad (meaning "the praised one") preferring it against the
commonly used names, hoping that Allah will praise him in the
heavens and so would His creations on earth.11

Advantages in this Choice
1.

The Arabs of the time were in the habit of looking down upon
those who were not of noble lineage. Allah (M) willed that no
enemy of Islam should find a pretext for hindering the people
from the way of Allah. Also, it was so arranged that no one
should think that Muhammad

was trying to gain a higher

position in the society by claiming to be a Prophet, or that it was
devised to be a means Tor a change in social position.
2.

Allah's choice of the Arabs is one of the evidences that He approves
of them and so in their turn the people should also approve of
them. But this of course, as a race, and not as individuals. For, as
individuals they can deviate from Islam, in which case those
individuals might be disapproved of, not all the Arabs.

Circumcision and Naming
Scholars are divided over his circumcision. Some say he was
born circumcised. Others say his grandfather circumcised him when
he was seven days old, invited people to a meal, and named him
Muhammad.12 But the preferred opinion of some of the earliest

12 Narrated by Walid bin Muslim on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas 4 and has
been transmitted by Dhahabi in Tarikhul-Islam, p. 27. Dhahabi said about
Ibn Sa'd's narration, that this is more trustworthy than the one reported by
Ibn Sa'd (1/103) and attributed to 'Abbas 4 to the effect that, he was born
circumcised" The two editors of Zadul-Ma'ad (1/82/f.n. 1) said, regarding
Walid bin Muslim's statement that "This is not Sahih, because Abu Hatim
described Muhammad bin Abu Sariy as weak in Hadith. And Ibn 'Adi
described him as a (narrator) of too many errors. Further, Walid bin Muslim
is one of those who dropped the immediate preceding narrator, while
sometimes he narrated without naming the narrators." Ibn Qaiyim
mentioned in Zadul-Ma'ad (1/82) what Ibn Abdul-Barr considered this
Hadith of Musnad as Unfamiliar (Gharib). Yahya bin Ayyub-one of the
Hadith narrators thought that he searched for this Hadith but could not find
it with any one of the people of Hadith he met except with Ibn Abu Sariy.
Ibn Qaiyim then added: "This problem took place between two pious men,
one of them was Kamaluddin bin Talhah, who wrote a book in which he
mentioned that the Prophet £ was born circumcised and supported it wit a

scholars is that he was born circumcised.13

When 'Abdul-Muttalib was asked why he didn't use one of the
names commonly used by his family, he replied that he wished that
Muhammad be praised by Allah in the heavens and by the people
on earth.14
The Prophet j|§ was known by other names too. He said, "I
have several names. I am Muhammad. I am Ahmad. I am Al-Mahi
(the Obliterator) who will obliterate disbelief, I am Al-Hashir (the
Gatherer) after whom Allah will gather the people for reckoning.
And I am Al-'Aqib." The narrator added, '"Aqib is someone after
whom no Prophet will appear.'"13 Ibn Sa'd16 added another name:

Al-Khatim (the seal of the Prophets). Imam Muslim1' has added two
more names: Al-Muqaffa (meaning the Last One) and NabiyyurRahmah (the Prophet of Mercy). Tirmidhi18 in his turn added one
more: Nabiyyul-Maldhim19 (the Prophet after whom a big battle will
take place — Translator).

as many Ahadith as possible with no basis whatsoever. This was contra¬
dicted by Kamaluddin bin 'Adim, where he explained that the Prophet sg
was circumcised according to the Arab tradition; and that this practice was
well-known for evidences to be established. Allah knows best.”
13 Abu Nu'aym in his Dald'il narrated that the Prophet
said, "One of the
miracles bestowed upon me by Allah was that I was bom circumcised and
no one saw my private parts." The two verifiers said, "This Haditii was
also reported by Tabarani in Iris Al-Awsat. Hakim said in Al-Mustadrak (2/
602): "Numerous Ahadith speak of the Prophet ^ being bom
circumcised." See As-Siratun-Nabawiyyah by Ibn Hibban, p. 58, and AsSiratush-Shamiyyah (1/420-421). Shaykh Tarhuni has also lent strength to
the view. See Sahihus-Siratin-Nabawiyyah, f.n. 141, reports on the grand¬
father performing the circumcision. See Ibn Kathir, Al-Bidayah (2/287-288).

From Birth to Emigration

Some reports say that his mother named him Ahmad. Ibn Sa'd
carries a report through 'Ali

to this effect. Since his father passed

away while he was in his mother's womb, it was natural that his
mother bore the responsibility of naming him. This is reported by
Ibn Sa'd20 who depends on Waqidi through Ibn 'Ali who said,
"Aminah was inspired to name him Ahmad even while he was in
the womb.'' A report in Abu Nu'aym21 (Dalail An-Nubuwwah)
coming through Buraydah and Ibn 'Abbas also supports this. They
said, "Aminah saw a dream. She was told, 'You have conceived the
best of mankind, and a leader of the people. When you give birth to
him, name him Ahmad and Muhammad.
report as does BayhaqiA It says,

Ibn Ishaq ^ has a similar

Aminah used to say that when

she had conceived him she was told in a dream, 'When he is born,
name him Muhammad, for his name is Ahmad in the Torah and the
Gospels. He will be praised by those in the heavens and those on the
earth. In the Qur'an his name will be Muhammad." So she gave him
that name. The report ends with a note that she had asked AbdulMuttalib to name him Muhammad. 'Abdul-Muttalib said a poetical
piece in response. Its last line said, "Ahmad is written on the
tongues." Ibn 'Asakir24too has a similar narrative.
Later, he acquired the surname Abul-Qasimy5 ordering his
followers not to use his surname,26 although they could use his
name for naming their children. Jibril m had surnamed him Abu
Ibrahim, but he himself disapproved that he should be known by a

while others we did not. Bayhaqi in his Dalail (1/151-161) and As-SiratushShdmiyyah (1/512-663). Shami counted it in alphabetic order.

have been differences in opinion over the use of his surname —
whether the forbiddance was until his death, or remains forever.
Some have said that his name and surname may not be adopted
together by an individual.28
Although there were a few people in pre-Islamic times named
Muhammad, from the expectation that a Messenger was about to
arise, there was no one named Ahmad before him.29

Orphanhood and Guardians
Historians disagree over the date of his father's death. Ibn
Ishaq,30 seconded by Ibn Sa'd,31 said that he died while the Prophet

M, was in his mother's womb. Most scholars,32 such as Dhahabi33
and Ibn Kathir34 (.Al-Biddyah wan-Nihayah), believe in this. This
seems to be the implication of the Verse:

It is also popularly believed that he was born an orphan in
Makkah on Monday, the 12th of Rabi'ul-Awwal,36 in the year
known as the Year of the Elephant.37 The Orientalists believe that it
coincided with the year 570 AC. But the astronomer Mahmud
Pasha's calculations show it as the 9th of Rabi'ul-Awwal, coinciding
with 20th of Nisan, 571 AC.38
Since his father was dead, his grandfather became his custodian,
although he remained with his mother Aminah bint Wahb.39 His

was returning to Makkah after she had gone to Yathrib43 for a visit
to the Prophet's maternal uncles, the Banu 'Adi bin Najjar.44
His freed slave-girl and nurse Umm Ayman brought him to his
grandfather at Makkah. The latter took great care of him until his
death. The Prophet 3g| was eight year old then 4:1 Before his death he
ordered that Muhammad be handed over to his uncle Abu Talib,
i.e.,46 the real brother of the Prophet's father. Their mother, that is,
'Abdul-Muttalib's wife, was Fatimah bint 'Amr bin 'A'idh 47
Several reports have come to us about the great care 'AbdulMuttalib bestowed on his grandson. It is reported by Abu Ya'la4S

Mu'jamul-Buldan (1/79). And it was said that it is one of the the Tihamah
valleys of Hijaz where the two valleys of Al-Fara' and Al-Qahah meet, so
they join together to make one stream and pour into the sea passing by
Masturah village. See A'iq Al-Biladi: Mu'jamul-Ma''dlimil-Jughrafiyah fis-Sirah.

(.Mursal) line of narration — Ibn Hisham (1/222-223), 'Abdur-Razzaq: AlMusannaf (5/318) through a Mursal report. And Mursal of Ibn Ishaq and
Mursal of 'Abdur-Razzaq are Sahih reports. The two reports are supported
by the narration of Ibn Sa'd. As regard to the news of his mother's death
at Abwa' while he was still very young, it came through different ways
that reach the level of Hasan li Ghairihi. See the details of this in SahihusSirat by Shaykh Tarhuni, f.n. numbers 165 and 166.

and Tarikh Makkah by Azruqi (1/314, 315) with a Good (Hasan) chain;

the story has some evidences, one of them being what Bayhaqi reported in

that once he sent the child to look for a camel that was lost. When
the Prophet ^ took a long time to return, he got extremely worried,
to the extent that when he appeared with the camel, he promised
himself that he will never send him on any errand anytime and will
never let him out of sight.
He kept the Prophet ^ close to him and would not allow
anyone to visit him when he was asleep. He had appointed for him
a place next to himself and no one was allowed to occupy that place.
When he took his appointed place in the shadow of the Ka'bah, with
his children around him, Muhammad sat beside him.49
History books tell us that Abu Talib also took extreme care of
him. He wouldn't let him sleep but next to himself, wouldn't go
anywhere without taking him along, and offer him the best part of
the food. In fact, he wouldn't eat until the Prophet $g| had joined
him.50 He maintained these habits until he died some three years
before the Prophet's emigration to Yathrib.

Wisdom in the Orphanhood
It was Allah's Will that the Prophet i| should grow up an
orphan, uninfluenced by his parents. His father died before his birth
and the mother did not influence him much because most of his
childhood was spent in the deserts in the family of Banu Sa d. There
too he didn't live long and was returned to the care of his
grandfather. This took care of any possible future allegation that the
Prophet

was groomed by his parents and others for his mission

604). Dhahabi agreed with him., Bayhaqi: Dalail (2/20-21) through two
lines of narration, one of which is in Al-Hakim.

49 Azruqi: Tarikh Makkah (1/314-315) through a Good (Hasan) chain, and the
story has other supporting narratives which we mentioned m footnote no

223).

50 At-Tabaqat (1/119-120), through Waqidi and Waqidi is Abandoned
(Matruk) therefore the chain is very weak. However what strengthens the
fact that Waqidi's narration has a basis are the Sound (Sahih) reports
concerning the Prophet's meeting with the monk Bahira while the Prophe
m was traveling to Sham in his youth, as will come later in this book.

right from his childhood. Or that they taught him to seek glory by
false means. It is another thing that he need not have to resort to
such false means because his grandfather was a highly respectable
man of the tribe. He held the honourable post of feeding and
watering the pilgrims.51
Perhaps too, there is a lesson in his orphanhood for orphans of
all times: it is not a stigma to be an orphan, and it does not come in
the way of a person attaining high status.

Signs of Prophethood at Birth
Some signs of prophethood accompanied him at birth. One of
the proven ones coming through trustworthy reports is in the
Prophet's own words. He said, "I am the answer to the prayer of
Ibrahim and the 'one' promised by 'Isa. When my mother was
pregnant with me she saw that a light emerged from her womb
which illuminated the palaces of Busra in the Syrian region."52
Although the following is not confirmed through trustworthy
reports, it is commonly said that when he was bom, fourteen
balconies broke down in Kisra's palace, the Fire the Magians
worshiped extinguished, the sea roared up with high waves against
Sawah and the temples around it crumbled down.53

51 See Dr. Muhammad Sa'eed Ramadan Buti: Fiqhus-Sirah, pp. 50-51.
Recorded by Ahmad in Al-Musnad (4/127 and 5/262) narrated by Irbad
bin Sariyah, Abu Umamah, Abu Nadr and Faraj. Haythami said in AlMajma' (8/212): “The attribution of Ahmad is Good (Hasan)." That report
says, “I saw a light emanate from me that lightened the palaces of Sham.”
Hakim also reported in his Al-Mustadrak (2/616-617), in similar words as
in Musnad of Ahmad. He said, "This is a Sound (Sahih) report that meets
with the conditions laid by Muslim. Dhahabi agreed with him. Ibn Ishaq
also reported with a Hasan chain as in Sirat Ibn Hishdrn (1/219-220). Thus,
the unknowability of a Companion does not adversely affect the narration.
Hence Ibn Kathir said in his book Al-Bidayah wan-Nihdyah that this
attribution is Perfect & Strong (Jaiyid-Qawi).
This has been reported through a lengthy narration in reference to Satih
and his nephew Abdul-Masih. See Dalail An-Nubuwwah of Bayhaqi (1/
126-129). The verifier of the work Dr. 'Abdul-Mu'ti Qal'ahji said about it:

It is commonly reported by the biographers and historians that
it was Halimah bint Dhu'ayb Sa'diyah who breast-fed him when she
took him to her relatives in the deserts. He remained with her until
he was about four. Then she brought him back to his mother.
But Ibn Ishaq54 is alone in narrating this story, which happens
to be through an Interrupted (.Munqati') chain of narrators. One of its
narrators is 'Abdullah bin Ja'far who never met Halimah. Another
narrator is Jahm bin Jahm, about whom Dhahabr5 said that his
identity could not be traced. Nonetheless, Abu Ya la 6 as well as Ibn
Hibban57 (in his Sahih) have reported this event. But, as Albani58 has
pointed out, the report does not say anything about 'Abdullah
having met Halimah. Ibn Hajar59 seems to have erred when he said
that 'Abdullah met and spoke to Halimah. Tabarani60 has also
preserved this report and Haythami61 gives his approval to both the

"This Hadith is not authentic." Also see the report in Al-Bidayah wanNihayah (2/291-292). And Ibn Kathir said about it, "As for this Hadith, it
has no basis in the well-known books of Islam. And I don t see that its
chain of narration has any basis either." The two verifiers of Data il AnNubuwwah of Abu Nu'aym commented (1/139-141) after verifying the
storv. Ibn 'Asakir said: This Hadith is Unfamiliar (Gharib) and we only
know it through Makhzum and he through his father. Abu Ayyub Bajah,
"Ali was a lonely narrator of this Hadith. Ibn Hajar said m Al-lsabah: This
Hadith is Disconnected (Mursal).

narrations. But the two editors of Ibn Hisham's62 Sirat as well as
Albani63 have declared this report weak.
Nonetheless, and despite the fact that the report has been
declared weak, it is beyond doubt that the Prophet

was nursed by

Banu Sa'd tribe.64 This is because reliable reports say that the
incident of the opening of the chest happened when the Prophet
was with Banu Sa'd. Hakim,65 Ahmad66 and Ibn Ishaq67 have all
reported the words, "I am the answer to Ibrahim's prayer ... and I
was nursed by Banu Sa'd bin Bakr..." Ibn Ishaq68 has also reported
through satisfactory sources that the Hawazin delegation told the
Prophet 3§; (when he was in Ji'ranah, returning from Hunayn),
"Among the slaves (that you have taken at Hawazin) are your own
aunts and those who took care of you (in your childhood)." This
report conforms the nursing of the Prophet

by the tribal people

around Ta'if, i.e., Hawazin. Banu Sa'd were one of them and
Halimah bint Abu Dhu'ayb69 belonged to them.

reported by Tayalisi in his Musnad, as also in Minhahil-Ma'bud (2/86) and
Tabararu in Al-Kabir. However, their reports have one called Ibn Fadalah
in the chain and he was considered weak.

inability to identify a Companion has no effect. That is why Ibn Kathir

which asserts that the Prophet |jg was nursed by the Banu Sa'd. Yet
another report from Ibn Sa'd71 says that it was the Prophet s mother
who had handed him over to Banu Sa'd.
Ibn Kathir72 mentions Abu Nu'aym's report through 'Utbah bin
'Abdullah that a man asked the Prophet gg, "What were you like in
the beginning, O Messenger of Allah?" He replied, "I was nursed by

One might add to the, above reports, the incident of his foster
parents visiting him (while he was still with his mother in Makkah.

battle of Hunayn/3

bin 'Asim Kilabi who was trustworthy but there was some problem with
his memory.

72 Al-Bidayah {1/299) and at checking out with Dalail An-Nubuwwah by Abu
Nu'aym Isfahani (1/220) we could not find the text of the Hadith
mentioned by Ibn Kathir. But rather we discovered him saying, "'AbdurRahman bin 'Amr narrated it through 'Utbah bin 'Abd. The two of them
agreed that he (the Prophet #|) was suckled in the tribe of Banu Sa d. And
the report has already been stated earlier." However, the two verifiers said
in the footnote: "This Hadith was not mentioned earlier, and it looks as it
it is one of those that the the compiler deleted." Further, they said about
the Hadith of 'Utbah bin 'Abd: "Reported by Ahmad and Tabaram without
mentioning the chain." And Ahmad's chain of narration is of Good
(Hasan) status. Refer back Majmauz-Zaua'id (8/222). Also reported by
Darimi in his Sunan (no. 13) and said in Al-Khasd'is "AHnad Darmu^and

Its mention will be made at the proper place in this work under
Hunayn. See Ibn Kathir: Al-Bidayah (2/301 and after). It is wor
mentioning here that the biographers reported that in addition
Halimah another woman from Banu Sa'd nursed him She nursed
together with his unclp Hamzah at the very time that he was being
suckled in Banu Sa'd. See in this regard Ibn Sad (1/109) through Waqidr

with Banu Sa'd. The most famous is the one narrated by Halimah
herself in which she says that the moment she accepted the child

Muhammad as well as her own child were able to suck, although
her son had cried incessantly out of hunger because her breast
had run dry. Also, the formerly dry udders of the beast they had,
were filled with milk once they had Muhammad with them.
Everyone of the family drank of the beasts, which in their turn
became healthier and stronger. It is also said that whenever
Halimah let loose her sheep, they found fresh fodder, which the
other animals missed. Muhammad's own growth was faster than
those of other children.74

Wisdom in being nursed in the Deserts
It was the practice of the Arabs of that time to send their
children to the deserts to save them from the evils of city life, make
them physically tough, teach them self-reliance, far away from the
passionate doting of the mothers, grandmothers and relatives. It
also helped in teaching them the language, spoken in its pristine
chastity in the deserts.

the freed slave girl of his uncle Abu Lahab who also nursed Abu
Salamah along with him. See Al-Bukhari/Al-Fath (19/171-73/H. 5100 and
5101) and Muslim (92/1072/H. 1449). Ibn Sa'd reported through his
teacher Waqidi that Thuwaybah nursed Hamzah before the Prophet m„
At-Tabaqat (1/108-109). Ibn Hajar said in Al-Fath (11/44): "Mus'ab
Zubayri narrated that Thuwaybah had suckled the Prophet ^ after she
had suckled Hamzah. Thereafter she suckled Abu Salamah. She was a
freed slave who belonged to Abu Lahab whom he had freed her after
which she had breast-fed the Prophet #5. Someone of his family saw
Abu Lahab after his death in an awful condition. He was asked the
reason and he answered: I found no good after you except that I was
given this little water pointing to the hollow of his thumb-for freeing
Thuwaybah." See Al-Bukhari/Al-Fath (19/173/H. 5101) and Ibn Qaiyim:
Zadul-Ma'ad (1/82) footnote 2.

The Opening of the Chest

This incident took place while the Prophet j|| was spending
his time in the deserts. This is emphatically stated by Abu Nu'aym
as also by Ibn Kathir.75 The report said, " My nurse was of the
Banu Sa'd. One day I went out (into the pasture grounds) with
their children herding cattle. We hadn't taken our lunch packets
with us. I told my foster brother, 'Brother. Why don't you run
back and bring us our lunch packets from our mother?' He
returned and I stayed back with the cattle. At that moment two
white falcon-like birds descended. One of them asked the other: Is
he the one?' The other replied, 'Yes.' They hastened towards me,
seized me, and laid me down on the ground. Then they opened
my chest. They took my heart out and opened it too. They
removed two black pieces of flesh. One of them said, Let me have
the iced water.' They washed the inner part of my breast. Then one
of them again said, 'Pass the hail-water.' They washed my heart
therewith. Then one of them said,

Let me have the Sukincih

(tranquility)/ and placed it in my heart. Then one of them told the
other, 'Stitch it up.' The other stitched it up and sealed my heart
with the seal of 'The Final Prophet.' Then one of them said, 'Place
him in one pan against a thousand of his followers in the other
pan.' Suddenly I saw a thousand men stacked together on the pan.
I feared they would topple down. One of the two said, 'If you
weighed his whole nation against him, his pan would still tilt
down.' Then they left me. I was extremely disturbed. I went back
to my (foster) mother and narrated the whole story. She was afraid
I was attacked by the jinn and only said, 'May Allah safeguard
you' Then she got a camel ready and put me behind her on it
until we reached my mother. She told her, 'I have brought back
the one you entrusted me with.' She also told her the whole story.
My mother was least disturbed. She said, 'When he was in my
womb I saw in a dream that a light emerged from my womb that
illuminated the Syrian palaces.

75 Al-Biddyah wan-Nihdyah (2/299). Dhahabi said in his Sirat, p. 48: "It is a
Sound (Sahih) report."

The Prophet of Islam

110

Muslim76 has also mentioned this event of the opening of the
chest, though in a shorter form, without mentioning the place where
it occurred. His narration reports Anas 4k, as saying, "Jibril came to
the Prophet while he was playing with the children. He seized him,
laid him down, cut open his chest, removed the heart, threw away a
piece of flesh from it saying, 'This was Satan's share of you.' He
washed his heart in a golden tray with Zamzam water. Then he
stitched it and placed it back in the breast. The children ran up to
their mother and told her, 'Muhammad has been murdered.' They
hurried to him to find him (standing there) pale." Anas added, "I
have seen the stitch marks on his chest."
Some of the sources have said nothing about when this incident
took place.77 As for those who mentioned it, they don't seem to have
agreed on a date. Ibn Ishaq

is one of them. He says the Prophet's

age at that time was a little more than two. He reports Halimah's
words, "He hadn't achieved the age of two but was already a
mature tough boy. So we went back to his mother, although we
were anxious to retain him with us ... (we convinced her to allow
him to live with us for some more time, and she agreed). So we
returned with him. And, by Allah it was not long after we had
returned that this incident (the visit of the angels) took place right
behind our tents." On the other hand, Ibn Sa'd'g says that the
Prophet 3g| was four years old when the incident took place. This is
also the opinion of Abu Nu'aym.80 Others have said that he was
six81 or older.82

but the chain has not been mentioned. It was mentioned that other than
Ibn 'Abbas used to say that Halimah returned the child to his mother after
the incident when he was four years of age.
See: Al-Mawahibul-Ladunniyah with Zurqani's commentary (1/149-150) and
Al-Biddyah (2/300-301) where Umawi's narration has been mentioned but

in

We are inclined to share /urqani's'" opinion and of Ibn Sa'd,
that he was four at the time of the incident. For, that is the age when
a boy is smart enough to look after the cattle and is conscious of
what is happening around him.
I lowever, the incident of the opening of the chest happened
more than once. Ahmad,84 Ibn 'Asakir85 and others have reported
that it took place once again when he was around ten years old.
Nonetheless, Bukhari,86 Muslim,87 Ahmad,88 Hakim89 and Tirmidhi90 have reports that it happened when he was fifty, at the time he
was taken to Jerusalem in his night journey. Dhahabi^1 believes the
opening of the chest happened only twice: once when he was a child
and another time before his night journey to Jerusalem, while there
are others who maintain that it happened four times.31
The Orientalists and those who follow them from among the
Muslims have, however, tried to interpret the incident in other
ways. Some have said that it is folk tale pure and simple. Others
have said it was only a spiritual experience, and so on.
The best course is that which was adopted by Ibn Hajar94 who
said that the narration has come down to us through so many
reliable sources that there has to be some substance to it. Further,

is Disconnected (Mursal) reaching up to Ibn Musaiyab. It is weak for
another reason: the presence of 'Uthman Waqqasi who was weak as Ibn

such matters cannot be explained in rational terms, for, these are
Allah's acts. He has power over everything.
Muslims should know that the rejection or acceptance of a
report depends on the strength and reliability of the reporters. If
their trustworthiness is proved, there is nothing left to discuss about
its occurrence, or interpretation, in the light of a distorted reason, as
is the habit of the rationalists.

It appears as if this incident was to indicate right in childhood
that Muhammad

was meant to be a Prophet. That would

make it easier for the people to accept him as a Messenger when
commissioned. It was a spiritual cleansing which was adminis¬
tered by physical and material means to announce Allah's
intention to the people.95

along with a few other important Quraysh men. When they

reached the monk —that is,

Bahira —they alighted. The monk

came out, departing from his practice of never coming out to
meet anyone or paying anyone any attention. He came down to
them while they were still unpacking. He held the Prophet's hand
and said, “This is the most important person for the humans.
Allah has sent him as a measure of mercy unto both the worlds."
Someone from the Quraysh chieftains said, “How do you know
that?" He said, "As you approached from the rear-hill, every
stone

They

never

prostrate

themselves but to a Prophet. I also know him from the mark of
prophethood he carries a little below his shoulder." Thereafter he
went back and prepared some food for them. When he fetched it
the Prophet

was among the servants taking care of the beasts.

They sent him to the monk. As he began to approach, the monk
said, "Look at him. He has the clouds over his head." When he
neared them, he found that those who had come early had
already occupied the shade of the tree. But when he sat down,
the tree inclined to throw its shadow on him. The monk said,
"Look at the tree covering him with its shade." While he was
with them he urged them not to take him into the Roman
territories. For, if the Romans saw him, they would recognize
him,

and

kill

him.

Then,

as

the

monk

turned

to

go,

he

encountered seven soldiers of the Roman army. He faced them
and asked, "What brings you here?" They replied, "We have
been sent because 'this Prophet is to appear in this month. No
highway has been left but the ruler has sent soldiers to check,
and we have been told that he might be coming by this road of
yours." He asked, "Has he, (the ruler) sent (after him) anyone
better than you?" They said, "No. We have only been informed
that he might be found on this way of yours." He asked, "Do
you think that if God has willed that he be raised, can any of the
people turn that decision back?"

They said, ' No.

So, they

entered into allegiance^ with him and went into his monastery.
The monk asked (the Quraysh), "By God. Tell me who is his
caretaker?" They said, "Abu Talib." He persisted in persuading
him until he decided to send back Muhammad in the company of
Abu Bakr and Bilal. The monk also provided Muhammad with
some cake and olives.'

Scholars have different opinions about this report. Tirmidhi has
said that it is Good (Hasan). But Hakim,97 Albani,98 'Urjun,9 ’
Shu'ayb and 'Abdul-Qadir Arna'ut100 have accepted it as Sound

(Sahih). Ibn Hajar has said,101 "I ts reporters are trustworthy and
there is nothing objectionable in it except the mention of Abu Bakr
and Bilal. It is possible that this piece was interpolated by one of the
narrators, or inserted by mistake." Ibn Qaiyim10- has said that the
error of the last sentence is quite apparent.
Dhahabi103 however does not accept the report. He wrote, "It
is Denounced (Munkar) report. The Prophet #£ was then around ten
years old. And Abu Bakr was younger than him by two and a half
years. Where was Bilal then? Abu Bakr purchased him only after
the Prophet s|| was commissioned (some 30 years later). At the
time of the incident, Bilal was perhaps not even bom. Moreover, if
there was a piece of cloud providing shade to the Prophet #g,
where was the need for the tree to bend forward and provide him
the shade? Again, Abu Talib never spoke of the incident to anyone
thereafter. Nor did the Quraysh ever discuss it. Surely, an incident

Shaykhain (Bukhari and Muslim).

98 Footnotes of Fiqhus-Sirah by Ghazali, p. 68, Difa', p. 62-72. He said: “Its
chain is Sahih as Jazari said." He said: “But the mention in the report of
Abu Bakr and Bilal has not been preserved properly." Then he added: It
was reported by Bazzar who said: “His uncle sent a man to accompany
him."

100Footnote of Zad (1/76) and he said while tracing this Hadith: "Its
attribution is Sahih. Hafiz Ibn Hajar said in Al-Isabalr. Its narrators are
trustworthy, but the mention of Abu Bakr and Bilal has not been
preserved (in any report). Bazzar reported it in his Musnad and added:
And his uncle sent along with him another man." Abdul-Qadir Arna'ut,
the verifier of Jami'ul-Usul said in his footnote (11/261), after tracing it,
"And the mention of Bilal has not been preserved. The great scholars have
considered it an illusion for the age of the Prophet
at that time was 12
years, and Abu Bakr was two years younger than him, and Bilal may not
have been born at that time."

of this sort could not have gone undiscussed. Actually, the news
should have spread far and wide. Moreover, the Prophet $=« himself
would have retained it in his memory and would not have been so
surprised when first addressed by revelation. In contrast, initially
he failed to understand what it was about and went to Khadijah %
in fear of his life. Further, if Abu Talib apprehensively sent him
back, how did he later allow him to travel to Sham, trading on
behalf of Khadijah? Also, the Hadith diction and style is that of the
Sufi orders. Finally, Ibn'A'idh has a similar report to narrate in
some of the biographical works, but without the sentence that
speaks of Abu Bakr and Bilal."
Ibn Kathir104 has written, "It has some Unfamiliar (Gharib)
parts. Moreover, the report does not reach the Prophet

himself. It

stops at Abu Musa Ash'ari who embraced Islam in the year of
Khayber, that is, in the seventh year after Hijrah. Further, the cloud
is not mentioned in better transmitted versions." He goes on to raise
the same questions as Dhahabi's.
Ibn Sayyidin-Nas105 has said that some parts of the report are
Denounced

(Munkar). Dhahabi's106 opinion expressed in his

abridgement of Al-Mustadrak is that it is a Fabricated (Maudu')
report, some parts of it are hard to accept (Bdtil). 'Abdur-Rahman
Wakil107 has said in his notes on Ar-Rawdul-Unuf that the part that
mentions Abu Bakr and Bilal is Denounced (Munkar).
We are however inclined to accept the report along with such of
those who did not reject it such as, Tirmidhi, Hakim, Ibn SayyidinNas, Jazari, Ibn Kathir, 'Asqalani, Suyuti, Ibn Hajar, Albani and
others. The main point of contention is the mention of Abu Bakr and
Bilal, which could be an interpolation by one of the narrators.
Ibn Ishaq108 too has mentioned this story in the same words as
of Tirmidhi, missing out on Abu Bakr and Bilal. However, he does

not trace the chain of narrators. He depends on versions as found in
biographical works. However, it is understandable that every
version without a chain of narrator has a source from where it
was picked up.109
As regards Ibn Kathir110 declaring it weak because Abu Musa
embraced Islam only after the fall of Khayber, we might point out,
apart from Ibn Kathir's own effort to clear the issue, that there is
another version narrated by Razin111 through 'Ali bin Abu Talib,
and he from his father. Ibn Athir112 has said that there aren't great
many differences between that narration and the one of Tirmidhi
through Abu Musa. This weakens the weakness theory.* 11" Finally, a
report reaching a Companion through trustworthy narrators is
considered trustworthy by most scholars.
Umawi114 has narrated that the Prophet

travelled with his

uncle Zubayr to Yemen when he was a little more than ten years
old. It is reported, although not through strong chains of narration,
that they saw a few signs during this journey. One of them was that
a camel cut across their path in one of the valleys. When it saw the
Prophet 3||, it kneeled down and placed its neck down on the
ground (in submission). The Prophet ^ rode upon it. Another is
that once a flooded pool lay before them. Allah (5g) dried it up for
them to help them cross the valley.

earlier people knew through their Scriptures the attributes of the
Prophet #§ and had some idea about when he was to be sent.
The following Qur'anic Verse also confirms this. It said about the
Jews,

“And when a Book from Allah came to them, confirming that
which is with them, while they were seeking victory over the
pagans (by him); but when that came which they recognized (as
Allah's revelation), they denied it. So Allah's curse be upon the
disbelievers.''115
Bukhari116 has reported on the authority of 'Ata bin Yasar that
'Abdullah bin 'Amr said that the Qur'anic Verse,

"O Prophet. We have sent you a witness, a harbinger of good

news and a Warner,’’117
is in the Torah in the following words, "O Prophet. We have sent
you a witness, an evangelist and a saviour of the unlettered. You are
My slave and Messenger. I have named you Al-Mutawakkil, neither
coarse nor harsh nor shouting in the markets. He does not retaliate a
wrong with another wrong. Rather he overlooks and forgives. I shall
not deal him death until a misguided people have said, 'There is no
deity (worthy of worship) save Allah.' That testimony will give sight

to the blind, ears to the deaf and open the hearts of those whose
hearts are closed.”
The reason for men like Salman Farisi to accept Islam was the
search they had launched following Jewish and Christian prophe¬
cies.
We also know that the People of the Book tried to obliterate the
prophecy concerning the final Messenger from their holy Scriptures.
The Qur'an said,

<XJi

^

"Woe unto those who write the book by their hands and then say,
'This is from Allah,' in order to earn a paltry price."118'119
However they were denied complete success in their efforts, as
is evident from some of the prophecies still remaining in their
books.120 More specifically, some of the Gospels have the name of
the Prophet #t, his qualities, the time of his commissioning and the
place, all foretold. Dr. Muhammad Rawwas Qala'ji121 has written on
this topic in some detail, and we shall have more to write on this
topic in this work later.

Wisdom in Shepherding
1.

Ibn Ha jar126 reports the opinion of the scholars: "The wisdom in
Allah's Prophets shepherding cattle is to give them a firsthand
experience in looking after and managing the people. The
company of the cattle inculcates in a man high degree of patience
and tenderness towards his flock. While looking after the cattle,
gathering them together after their dispersal, driving them from
place to place, protecting them from their enemies such as wild
beasts and hustlers, learning the differences in their natural
dispositions, and that they disperse instead of staying together,
despite their weakness (against predators), the Prophets learnt
how to deal with the people who accepted their call. Further, the
Prophet's own acknowledgement (that he shepherded sheep),
despite the fact that he was the best of creatures, was to
acknowledge Allah's grace on him and his brother-Prophets.

It also apparent that despite the fact that his uncle was a well-todo man, although with a large family, the Prophet ^ did not
depend on him economically, rather, with the sensitivity
endowed to him, he ventured to earn whatever little he could to

123 Ibn Hajar mentions that^he scholars hold two opinions concerning the
meaning of the word Qararit in Arabic. First, Qirat (singular of Qararit),
which is a part of a dinar or dirham. Second, Qararit is the name of a

lessen his uncle's burden.
3.

Allah (3$) was fully capable of providing Muhammad #| with all
the comforts of life and free him from the trouble of earning his
livelihood. But Allah wished to impress on us that the best of
livelihood is that which a man earns for himself through his own
efforts, and that a man's value is in how much he can contribute,
through his meagre means towards the welfare of society.

4.

Those that are engaged in propagation and depend on people's
donations do not enjoy much respect. It is better for a person to
depend on his own meagre means of livelihood, and avoid
dependence on others, so that no one should taunt him over
material help, and so that he should be able to present his
message with full moral force.127

Allahs Special Care in safeguarding Him from Pagan Rituals
The Prophet #| had participated in the reconstruction of the
Ka'bah after its damage. He used to carry stones for construction.
He had a garment on. His uncle 'Abbas 4® suggested that he remove
his garment to use it on the head for carrying stones. When he
helped him do that, the Prophet ^ fell unconscious. He was never
seen naked by anyone thereafter.

1 7fi

On another occasion he was carrying stones for his Qurayshi
playmates. When he took his garment out to place it on his shoulder
to make carrying easier, an unseen person boxed him hard telling
him, "Don't remove your garment," and, tied it back on him. The
unseen person was not one of the boys he was playing with.129
It is also reported that Allah (M) saved him twice when he
wished to spend an evening in the manner young men spend their
evenings. However, there is a difference in opinion over the
narration. Hakim, Dhahabi120 and others have accepted the report

127 See Buti: Fiqhus-Sirah, pp. 54-55.

as Sound (Sahih), while Ibn Kathir131 and Albani132 have questioned
it giving reasons that sound strong.
The Prophet ^ also opposed his people —the Quraysh — known
as Hums,133 by starting his pilgrimage from 'Arafat, while the Hums
started from Muzdalifah alone. Jubayr bin Mut'im was surprised by
the Prophet's disagreement134 with the Quraysh. It was of course by
Allah's guidance, as Jubayr
himself said after he had embraced
Islam.135

Ishaq bin Rahwayh in his Musnad and Ibn Ishaq, Bazzar, Bayhaqi, Abu
Nu'aym and Ibn 'Asakir: all of them through 'Ali bin Abu Talib. Ibn Hajar
said: Its attribution is Good (Hasan), its chain is Uninterrupted (Musalsil)
and its narrators were trustworthy. Haythami said in his Majina (9/226):
"Reported by Bazzar and its reporters were trustworthy." Albani however
mentioned the following defects:
1. It was not according to the conditions set by Muslim as Hakim and
Dhahabi thought, because sometimes Muslim reports through Ibn Ishaq
while joining others with him, while Hakim does not quote through him
in conjunction with others.
2. Muhammad bin 'Abdullah bin Qays was not a completely righteous
person, and none have given him the clearance except Ibn Hibban who
was known of trusting Unknown (Majhul) reporters.
3. Muhammad bin Qays was not one of the narrators of Muslim. See the
rest of Albani's critical remarks in the footnote of Fiqhus-Sirah by Ghazali,
p. 73.
133 The Hums were the people who lived in the Haram and all those Arabs
who were born in the Haram or in the area in its immediate vicinity as
well as those who were with other tribes such as Kinanah and Jadilah.
They believed that they have attained a status higher than other Arabs,
and thus stood themselves out against others by abandoning to stand at
'Arafat and making Ifadah from there. See: Al-Bukhdri/Al-Fath (7/320/H.
1665) and Muslim (2/893-894/H. 1219) and Ibn Hisham (1/256) and Ibn

Islam did away with the practice of the so-called Hums that the
Quraysh practiced in pre-Islamic times. Allah (M) said.

"Thereafter, surge on from where the (common) people surge
r/136
on.
(Hums practice dictated that a man of the higher strata, such as
the Quraysh, may not visit certain sites during Hajj, although
necessary for the ordinary' people —Translator)
Bayhaqi137 has reported through Zayd bin Harithah that the
Prophet m never touched a deity. In pre-Islamic times he used to
prevent others from doing it. Similarly, at the time of circumambulation of the Ka'bah, he would not touch the deities Isaf and Na'ilah.
Ibn IshaqljR has reported that when the monk Bahira swore by
the Lat and 'Uzza, following the Quraysh practice, the Prophet #§
told him, "Don't ask me anything in the name of Lat and 'Uzza. I
have never hated anything more than I hate them."
Allah also saved him from the trappings of Shay tan139 both in

136 Surat Al-Baqarah: 199. And for the reason for its revelation see: Muslim (2/
894/H. 1219) and Ibn Ishaq without a chain of narration —Ibn Hisham (1/
261). And whatever is narrated without a chain is weak.
137Dala'il An-Nubuwwah (2/34), Al-Bidayah wan-Nihayah (2/312); Sirat of
Dhahabi, p. 81. Dhahabi said that this Hadith is Hasan. His redactor Dr.
Tadmuri said: "Narrated by Abu Ya'la, Bazzar, and Tabarani, Majma'uzZawaid (9/418)."
iWIbn Hisham (1/238) with a Suspended (Mu'allaq) chain, see Al-Bidayah (2/
312-13); Bayhaqi: Dala'il (2/35). But they are all weak attributions. As
regard to his not swearing by Lat and 'Uzza and detesting them, this has
been proved by Sahih Ahaadith. See Ahmad: Al-Musnad (i/222) with Sahih
attribution, narrated by Haythami in the Majma' (8/225) where he said
that its narrators were trustworthy men. The narrative goes this way: "At
the time when the Prophet #£ was married to Khadijah
their neighbor
used to say that he heard the Prophet sfe; saying to Khadijah, 'O Khadijah,
by Allah, I shall never worship Lat and 'Uzza. By Allah, I'll never worship
'Uzza.' Khadijah replied: 'Leave Lat, leave 'Uzza.'"
l3‘'See: Dalail by Abu Nu'aym (1/191); Al-Isdbah (2/389); Ahmad: Al-Musnad
(3/419), and others, his reporters are trustworthy, as said the two verifiers
of the Dala'il.

the pre-Islamic times as well as after.140
The Prophet #§ also refused to spend time near the Buwanah
deity at which place the Quraysh used to conduct celebrations once
every year. Abu Talib and his other uncles were very angry with
him over that. When the Prophet $fs was about to give in to their
pressure, Allah ($g) saved him by sending him a tall fair man who
commanded him not to touch the deities. After that the Prophet j|§
never participated in any of their celebrations.141
Bayhaqi142 reports that two angels advised him against visiting
the pagan sanctuaries and so he stayed away.

140 See: Dala'il An-Nubuwwah by Abu Nu'aym (1/192-212). Both of the chains
of narration are weak, because of the weakness of Husayn bin 'Abdullah.
However several Sahih or weak reports concerning the Prophet's abhor¬
rence of the idols add to its strength.
141 Ibn Sa'd: At-Tabaqdt (1/158) through Waqidi, through a weak chain.
142See the whole Hadith in Dala'il (2/35) and Al-Biddyah wan-Nihayah (2/312)
being one of the reports of Abu Shaybah. Ibn Kathir said about this
Hadith: "More than one Imam (of Hadith) rejected this Hadith because of
Abu Shaybah. Bayhaqi reported in his Dald'il (2/36) some scholars as
saying that the meaning of the Hadith is that, he was present when the
idols were being received, and that was before the revelation, and Allah
knows best."
Dhahabi mentioned in Mizanul-I'tidal (3/35) that 'Uthman bin Abu
Shaybah was one of those approved by the Shaykhayn in their Sahihayn (as
a narrator), and rejected the opinions of 'Uqayli and Azdi, who declared
the Hadith weak. On the other hand, Dr. 'Abdul-Mu'ti Qal'ahji, the
redactor of Dala'il Al-Bayhaqi, who is inclined to believe, said while tracing
this Hadith that, "Abu Ya'la, Ibn 'Adi and Ibn 'Asakir have reported it
through Jabir bin 'Abdullah."
Dhahabi reported it in his Sirah (see p. 79 and the following pages),
"Many Ahadith mention Allah's prevention of the Messenger % (from acts
of infidels) during the pre-Islamic times. Of these Ahadith some have full
chains of narration which he did not judge for veracity, neither he nor his
redactor Dr. Tadmuri, while some carry no chain of narration whatsoever.
On the other hand, Shaykh Tarhuni said the Sanad of the Hadith was of
the Sound (Hasan) type as mentioned in the Sahihus-Siratin-Nabawiyyah
(footnote no. 209).

Wisdom in the Prevention from Participation in Pagan Practices
1.

The reports impress on us that the Prophet

was guarded

against pagan practices both before and after he was commis¬
sioned. This arrangement was from Allah Himself in order to
render him and his commission unblemished.
2.

To get naked before the people is of the disapproved things.
Islam prohibits it except for special circumstances such as for
medical treatment.143

3.

In keeping the Prophet

away from pagan practices, there was an

indication that he was being prepared for an important mission.

The Fijar War
A battle that raged between Kinanah and Quraysh on one side
and Qays 'Aylan on another, was called the Fijar war because both
sides flouted the sanctity of the Haram.144 The reason for the battles
also happened to be something trivial. Following the slaying of a
single person the Quraysh came out for a fight, calling upon their
allies to help them.145
Ibn Ishaq145 recounts that when the battles took place, the Prophet
was about 20 years old. Ibn Hisham however believes the Prophet
was fourteen or fifteen and that he witnessed a few battles along with
his uncles. He said, "I used to collect arrows for my uncles.”
Since the Fijar battles lasted over a long period, it is possible to
say that both Ibn Ishaq and Ibn Hisham14' are correct. Perhaps the
Prophet jig; was around fifteen years old when the battles started
and twenty by the time they ended.

143See Ibn Hajar: Al-Fath (3/24).
144 See Ibn Hajar: Al-Fath (3/24).
145 Ibn Hisham (1/241-243) without a chain, so it is weak.
146 Ibn Hisham (1/243) without a chain, so it is weak.
147 (1/241) and look at its details there, pp. 241-242. As for the Hadith which
was attributed to the Messenger ^ had an Interrupted (Munqati') chain and
hence it is Weak (Da'if).

From Birth to Emigration

125

It is also known that the Prophet's direct involvement in any
battle has not been proved although he had reached the fighting age.
Suhayli148 however has thought the true reason was that the fight was
between unbelieving factions and a believer never participates in a
war unless it were to be for raising Allah's Word aloft.
I personally believe that if the report of his participation is true,
then it was only symbolic. It is also possible to say that the Prophet
#§ might have participated in the battle in defence of the holy places,
especially since Qays' Ailan (tribe) was the aggressor. Coming to the
aid of the oppressed has been a value upheld by the Prophets and
Messengers.

Participation in the Fudul Pact
Ahmad149 has a report according to which the Prophet s|§ said,
“I participated in the pact made by the good people150 (Banu
Hashim, Zuhrah and Makhzum) along with my uncles although I
was just a boy. And I wouldn't wish that I had a couple of red
camels in return of non-participation." Bayhaqi's words are:151 "I

148 A r-Rawdul- Unuf (1/ 209).
149 Al-Musnad (3/121/Shakir). Shakir said that the chain is Sahih.
150 Hashim, Zuhrah, and Makhzum were known as the Mutayyibun. This was
said by some of those who narrated Abu Hurayrah's Hadith, as found in:
Dald'il of Bayhaqi (2/38). Bayhaqi said: “It was in this way that one of the
men of Hadith explained it, but I don't know which one of them.'
It has already been mentioned that Ibn Ishaq—Ihn Hisham (1/179-181)
threw a hint at the Mutayyibun pact, which is where Quraysh differed
after Qusaiy: Banu 'Abd Manaf and those who allied with them, and Banu
'Abdud-Dar and those who allied with them. Banu 'Abd Manaf brought
out a bottle filled with perfume at the Ka'bah and the tribesmen immersed
their hands in it and contracted and pledged and vowed along with their
allies. Then they wiped the Ka'bah with their perfumed hands, and so
were called Mutayyibun. In response, Banu Abdud-Dar also pledged and
vowed along with their allies at the Ka'bah that they would not dishonor
each other and would not hand over each other to the enemy. They
therefore were called the Ahlaf.
151 Dalail An-Nubuwwah (2/37-38) Ibn Kathir: Al-Bidayah (2/315) reported by
Bayhaqi from different routes and it has a Sound (Sahih) chain.

The Prophet of Islam

did not participate in any pact except the pact of Hashim, Zuhrah
and Makhzum. And I don't break that pact for red camels."
Commenting on this report, Bayhaqi172 says that some people
think153 he meant the Fudul pact. That is because the Prophet
actually did not participate in the pact of Hashim, Zuhrah and
Makhzum. Then, later, in the same work As-Sunan Al-Kubra,l74
Bayhaqi says that he did not participate in the pact of Hashim,
Zuhrah and Makhzum. So, I am inclined to believe that it was the
Fudul pact that the Prophet #g was referring to.
It is possible to reconcile the reports of Ahmad, Bayhaqi and of
the biographers by assuming that the pact of Hashim, Zuhrah and
Makhzum was renewed during the Prophet's time and came to be
known as the Fudul155 pact.
Humaydi156 has recorded a tradition in which the Prophet f|j
said, "I was present in the house of 'Abdullah bin Jad'an17

152Dalail (2/38).
153 He is alleging to Ibn Qutaybah —the author of Al-Ma'arif who said that
Mutayyibun pact was no other than Fudul pact. Bayhaqi in As-Sunan AlKubra (6/367) censured him because the Prophet
was not yet bom. Ibn
Kathir agreed with this in Al-Bidayah wan-Nihayah (2/315), and asserted
that the pact mentioned in the Hadith as at which the Prophet
was
present was the Fudul pact. Dr. Qal'ahji said while editing Bayhaqi's
Dald'il that it became apparent from the studies of the sequence of the
story that Mutayyibun pact was made at the time of Hashim, the father of
'Abdul-Muttalib, the grandfather of the Prophet jjgj. However, Ibn Hisham
distinguished between the two pacts while Ibn Ishaq mentioned the
elements of each pact and the reason for each of the pact, illustrating that
there were differences between the two pacts. See the discussion in Ibn
Kathir (2/315-317) regarding this dispute, and also Bayhaqi in Dalail (2/
37-42) especially the footnote of the verifier.
154 (6/367).
155 See Ibn Athir: An-Nihayah fi Gharibul-Hadith wal-Athar, (3/456 under letters
Fa and Dad). Ahmad Shakir: his footnotes in Ahmad's Musnad (3/122),
and Shami in his book Subulul-Huda war-Rashad (2/209).
IMTbn Kathir quoted it from him in his Al-Bidayah wan-Nihayah (2/315) and it
has a Sahih chain. Shami said in his Sirat and Dr. Qala'ji redactor of
Bayhaqi's Dald'il, ''His words, 'Come into a pact.' up to the end, is an
interpolation by one of the narrators, and does not reach the Prophet jgj,
and, therefore, it cannot be argued with.

witnessing a pact that, were I to be invited to after Islam, I would
have responded. In that pact they agreed that things lost by the
people would be restored to them and that none will support the
oppressor.” Ibn Ishaq158 has transmitted a report that the Prophet ^
said, “I was present in the house of 'Abdullah bin Jad'an witnessing
a pact that I wouldn't exchange for a pack of red camels, and if I
were invited to it in Islam, I would respond.”
Banu Hashim, Banu 'Abdul-Muttalib, Banu Asad, Banu Zuhrah
and Banu Taym agreed by this pact that they would help the
oppressed against the oppressor. This was in Dhul-Qa'dah twenty
years before the Prophet ^ was commissioned 159 The Quraysh
were then returning from the Fijar battles. The Prophet $|| was
twenty. The Prophet's uncle Zubayr bin 'Abdul-Muttalib was the
one who had invited others to the pact.
The cause of the pact is said to be that a man from Zubayd came
into Makkah with some of his wares. 'As bin Wa'il Sahmi purchased
some goods from him. He was one of the chieftains. He held back
the price. The Zubaydi sought the help of his allies: 'Abdud-Dar,
Makhzum, Jumah and Sahm. They refused to help him against 'As,
rather, rebuked him. When the Zubaydi saw this, he climbed Abu
Qays Mountain at sunrise, while the Quraysh were around the
Ka'bah, and recited aloud a few poetical pieces. At that Zubayr bin
'Abdul-Muttalib got up and said, "Should such a man be refused
help?" So, Quraysh, Zuhrah and Taym assembled in the house of
'Abdullah bin Jad'an agreeing in Dhul-Qa'dah that they shall be one
body in helping the oppressed until the oppressor is forced to return
the dues —so long as the seas have waters,160 and so long as Thabir
and Hira' (mountains) remain in their places; and that they shall
support each other in matters of livelihood. So, the Quraysh called it
the Fudul pact (a useless pact), saying, "these people have ventured
into a futile pact." Then they went up to 'As bin Wa il, and restored
the Zubaydi's goods to him.161
158 Ibn Hisham (1/182-183). Its chain is Sahih but Mursal. But it is supported
by Humaydi's Hadith, which adds to its strength.

Lessons

1.

If pagans were conscious of the wrongness of oppression and
tried to prevent it, it is more deserving of the Muslims that they
should stand against it. Islam has come down to confirm what
is in human nature and is firmly opposed to oppression of any
kind. It is not surprising that the Prophet
mentioned the pact.
It contained articles that Islam invites people to.

2.

The part played by Zayd bin 'Abdul-Muttalib confirms the
good nature that the Banu Hashim were endowed with. It also
proves their superiority over other tribes, although, the fact that
the Prophet $|g was raised from among them, is enough proof of
superiority.

Marriage to Khadijah

'%>

Khadijah bint Khuwaylid bin Asad bin 'Abdul-'Uzza bin
Qusaiy bin Kilab was an intelligent, resourceful woman. She was
from the noblest of families and the richest of their women.
Important men of her family were covetous of her. She conducted
trade with the help of active partners who got a share in profits.
When she learnt of the Prophet's honesty, trustworthiness and high
moral qualities, she sent him a message expressing her desire that he
take her goods to Sham. She promised she would give him a greater
share of the profits than what she would normally give others. He
agreed to the terms and travelled in the company of Maysarah, a
slave provided by her. Maysarah reported back to Khadijah what he
saw of the Prophet's miracles. Impressed by them, she sent word
expressing the desire that they get married.162
Of the signs that Maysarah saw during the journey, one is that
when the Prophet
was near the Busra town in Sham, he alighted

and did not ascribe to any of the biographers, lbn Su'd (1/128-129)
reported it briefly through Waqidi. For more information regarding the
reasons for this nomenclature see Suhayli: Ar-Rawd (1/155).
162 lbn Ishaq, without chain — lbn Hisham (1/244-245).

129

near a tree. A monk living nearby called Nastura remarked, "No
one but a Prophet alighted under the shade of this tree. Has he a red
streak in his eyes?" When Maysarah said yes, and added that it
doesn't go, he said, "He is the Prophet, and the last of them."
Maysarah also noticed two angels shading the Prophet #| when
the day was hot. Another report says Khadijah herself noticed that
phenomenon at the time he entered Makkah at noon time. The same
report has it that the Prophet #§ and another man disagreed over a
deal. Tire man asked him to swear by Lat and 'Uzza. The Prophet
replied, "I have never sworn by them. I have been ordered to
abandon them."
The monk Nastura also told Maysarah, "This, by God, is the
Prophet that our Scripture experts find described in the holy
Scriptures." The story also has it that the profits earned by the
Prophet m on his trip to Sham were many fold greater than what
others had earned earlier. And Khadijah gave him a greater share
than what they had agreed on at the beginning, which itself was
higher than what she normally gave to others of the Quraysh.
Khadijah also mentioned to Waraqah details that Maysarah had
brought, such as Nastura's words, "No one but a Prophet alighted
under the shade of the tree," and, "two angels shaded him."
Waraqah said, "If this is true then he is the Prophet raised for these
people. I knew that he is to appear. The time is ripe.
It was these kinds of things that Khadijah heard from Maysarah
and Waraqah, apart from what she herself experienced of his
exemplary character that led her to make the proposal. She sent her
friend Nafisah bint Muniyah to propose to him. The Prophet gg
agreed and the two got married.164
163 Reported by Tabarani in Al-Awsat. Haythami said in his Majma (8/256),
"Its chain is Hasan. Also reported by Ibn Ishaq without a chain- n
Hisham (1/247). And Tabarani, proving that the Hadith reported by
Muhamily, Ibn Sad, and Ibn Ishaq has some basis. We shall soon mention
it, Allah willing.
164 Reported by Muhamily, as mentioned by Dhahabi in his Sir at, p. 64, being
a narration of Nafisah bint Munyah. Dhahabi however rejected the story
that mentions the Prophet’s journey to Sham as a merchant accordmg to

The Prophet of Islam

130

Bazzar165 and Tabarani166 have a report coming down from
Jabir ^ that Khadijah's sister had hired the Prophet j|§ and another
man for trading on her behalf. After they were back from their
journey, and the accounts were settled, a sum of money had to be
paid by Khadijah's sister. The other man kept demanding his share.
But when the Prophet #§ was reminded that he should also seek his
due, he replied that he was shy of asking. She reported this to
Khadijah. She was pleased by this and decided to marry him. She
asked him to seek her father's consent. The Prophet

told her,

"Your father is a rich man. I am afraid he wouldn't agree." She said
in reply, "Go and speak to him. I'll take care of him. Also, better see
him at a time he is drunk."
Khadijah Ap was previously married to

'Atiq bin 'A'idh

Makhzumi. She bore him a female child. After him she was married
to Abu Halah bin Nabbash Tamimi. She bore him a boy - Hind - and
a girl. Abu Halah died in pre-Islamic times.167
Ibn Sa'd168 however thinks that she was first married to Abu
Halah, whose name was Hind bin Nabbash bin Zurarah. She gave
birth to a son Hind. Then 'Atiq bin 'Abid bin 'Abdullah Makhzumi
married her. She bore him a girl, also called Hind. Thereafter, Sayfi
bin Umaiyah bin 'Abid bin 'Abdullah married her. Sayfi's
biography is available in Al-Isabah as well as Al-lsti'ab."

the Hadith of Nafisah bint Munyah in which it was mentioned that
Khadijah ^ sent Nafisah to the Messenger of Allah to propose marriage to
him. Dhahabi believes this story is weak because it includes 'Abdullah bin
Shabib who was a worthless person—Musa bin Shaybah who was weak
(in narration), and 'Umar bin Abu Bakr 'Adawi who was weak too. Ibn
Ishaq reported this Hadith without a chain-Ibn Hisham (1/244-245), and
Ibn Sa'd (1/129-133) with a weak chain.
165 See: Kashful-Astdr (3/237).

least.
167So said Ibn Hajar in his Al-Fath (14/287). See Ibn Asakir, pp. 140, 142, 148,
and 149. This was one of the reports of Ibn Ishaq in As-Siyar wal-Maghazi,
p. 245. It is also with Ibn Sa'd (8/15) as Ibn 'Abid. In Al-Ikmal (6/1) it is
Ibn 'Aidh.

Scholars differ over who got Khadijah married to him.
Bayhaqi171 said that it was her father Khuwaylid who married her
off to him in a state of drunkenness. But the narrator Mu'ammili,
'Umar bin Abu Bakr concludes that according to unanimous
opinion it was her uncle 'Amr bin Asad who married her off to
him. However, Haythami172 disregards this report on grounds that
this man Mu'ammili was abandoned by the scholars of Hadith as a
narrator. Ibn Ishaq173 is of the opinion (in his Subulul-Huda war-

Rashad) that it was her father who conducted the marriage. On the

169Muslim (4/1889/H. 2436), Ibn Hisham (1/246) but a Suspended (Mu'allaq)
report. Ibn Hajar said in Al-Fath (14/291): "At this point there is no
difference of opinion between the scholars."
170 Ibn Hajar: Al-Fath (14/286-295). Bukhari dedicated a whole chapter to it
under the title: The marriage of the Prophet #§ to Khadijah and her Virtues,
see: Al-Bukhdri/Al-Fath (14/286-295/H. 3818-3824). See Ibn 'Asakir: Tarikh
Madinati Dimashq, As-Siratun-Nabawiyyah, Part-1, p. 156, 157, and Ibn Sa'd
(8/16,17) who quoted through Waqidi. It is alleged that his age was thirty
years at that time. See Ibn 'Asakir, Tarikh Dimashq, As-Siratun-Nabawiyyah,
Part-1, p. 158. However its chain is weak, and it is a Contradicting (Shadhdh)
report as it opposes the opinion of the great majority.
171 Dalail An-Nubuwwah {2/71-72). But its chain is very weak, Ibn Ishaq. See
Ibn Hisham (1/246). However, it has strong supporting evidences such as:
(a) The Hadith of Ibn 'Abbas that was recorded by Bayhaqi in his Dalail
(73) with a weak chain (b) the Hadith of Abu Mijlaz mentioned in Ibn Sa'd
(1/132) with a weak chain, (c) the Hadith of Ibn 'Abbas recorded by
Ahmad: Al-Fathur-Rabbani (20/197) with a Strong (Qawi) chain; (d) The
Hadith of Zuhri which was reported by Bayhaqi in his Dald il (2/69) with a
Mursal chain.
172 Majma'uz-Zawaid (9/220-221). Bayhaqi reported in a different way than
Mu'ammili that her father approved her marriage when he was intoxi¬
cated. The verifier said: Imam Ahmad reported it in his Musnad (1/312) in
a lengthy manner but with a weak chain. Haythami also quoted it from
him in Majma'uz-Zawaid (9/220) and added, "Ahmad's men of narration
are trustworthy."

other hand Suhayli,174 Ibn Kathir175 and Shami1'6 say that Ibn
Ishaq's opinion in his biographical work is that it was her brother
'Amr bin Khuwaylid who took the responsibility. But, we don't find
this statement in the printed work of Ibn Ishaq. Waqidi1" on the
other hand, believes her uncle 'Amr bin Asad was the man who
assented to the marriage. He adds that whoever said other than this
is wrong for the simple reason that Khadijah's father died before the
Fijar battles. Suhayli,178 Ibn Sayyidin-Nas,174 Ibn 'Abdul-Barr180 and
Shami181 have seconded this opinion.
If it is true that Khadijah's father died before the Fijar battles,
then it must have been her uncle who conducted the marriage.
Nonetheless, the reports that speak of her father marrying her off,
are stronger. They come to us through several routes, although all
of them weak, but gather strength because of their number. It is
safe to say that there has to be some truth in the story. Allah
knows best.182
It is reported that it was Hamzah bin 'Abdul-Muttalib who
accompanied the Prophet ^ when he went to ask for Khadijah's
hand.

reported to the effect that it was her uncle who married her to the
Prophet
is what is mentioned by most of the Sirat scholars. To that
Suhayli added: "And that's correct, for what Tabari reported through
jubayr bin Mut'im, Ibn 'Abbas and 'Aishah
they all said: It was
'Amr bin Asad who married Khadijah to the Prophet
and that
Khuwaylid died before Fijar. Waqidi preferred it and considered other
than this as wrong."
1X2 Shaykh Muhammad bin Rizq bin Tarhuni thought that the story was
Hasan of status. He meant the story which that ascribed Khadijah's
father as the one who conducted the marriage in a state of drunken¬
ness. One might look into his book Sahihus-Sirah (1/215-216) for further
details.

The Prophet

held a special place in his heart for his wife

Khadijah. The Sahihayn183 and others have several reports on this
topic. She was endowed with admirable qualities and was
nicknamed as "The Pure"184 and "The Unblemished."185 Except
for Ibrahim through Mariyyah,186 she gave the Prophet #§ all the
children he had. It is generally agreed that she gave him Qasim —
hence the Prophet's acronym Abul-Qasim. But the child died in
infancy.

He also had four daughters through her: Zaynab,

Ruqayvah, Umm Kulthum and finally, Fatimah. It is said that after
the daughters she gave birth to a son 'Abdullah, who was born after
he was commissioned as a Prophet. The child was also known as
Tahir and Tayyib. But, according to some scholars, the two were

Ibn Hajar on the meaning 'he should not marry another besides her,' AlFath (14/291) and the comment of Nawawi on the Ahddith on the virtues
of Khadijah 4= in Muslim explained by Nawawi (15/202); Ibn Kathir: AlBiddyah wan-Nihdyah (2/318-320). As examples (one could quote) the
Prophet #1 saying: "The best of its women is Maryam (Mary), and the
best of its women is Khadijah," Al-Bukhari/Al-Fath (14/288/H. 3818) and
Muslim (4/1886/H. 2430). Narrated Abu Hurayrah
Jibril (Gabriel) came
to the Prophet gg and said, "O Allah's Messenger! This is Khadijah. She is
coming to you with a dish (or some food or drink). When she reaches
you, greet her on behalf of her Lord and on my behalf, and give her the
glad tidings of a palace made of a hollowed pearl in Paradise, wherein
there will be neither any noise nor any toil, Al-Bukhari/Al-Fath (14/293/

were: Qasim, Tayyib, and Tahir. See: Tasmiyatu Azwdjin-Nabi wa Awladuhu
by Abu 'Ubayd, pp. 48-53, Ibn Asakir: Tdrikh Dimashq, pp. 102-136, who
examined nearly all that had been said about the Prophet's sons, their date
of birth, their death, their number, their names, and their conditions when
alive or dead.

Waqidi, her age was 45 years, see Ibn 'Asakir: Tarikh Dimashq, SiratunNabawiyyah, section one, p. 157; but the narration is weak because

his mastery is not rejected in Siyar wal-Maghdzi. Ibn Kathir said about

135

It can be deduced from Khadijah's desire to marry him that the
Prophet #§ possessed an outstanding personality.

3.

The traditions that speak of the virtues of Khadijah 4b are proofs
of her cardinal qualities and the special status that she enjoys
with Allah, His Messenger ^ and the believers.

4.

There is nothing wrong in that a pious woman should make the
first move seeking to marry a pious man as Khadijah ^ did;
Muhammad

5.

attracted her by his piety.

The first thing that becomes apparent from this marriage is that
the Prophet

didn't follow his carnal desires. If he had been,

he would have looked for someone younger than himself, or, at
least someone not older than him, and by all means not a
widow. He seems to have been attracted to her because of her
good qualities — someone who had been nicknamed "the pure."
The marriage bond lasted until her death at sixty-five when the
Prophet |g was fifty. This is the period, from youth to middle
age, when a man wishes to have several wives. But the Prophet
wished no such thing. Had he wished, there was no shortage
of women both free and bonded. Had he done that, he wouldn't
have been breaking a tradition.
6.

The marriage of a noble and virtuous woman to a truthful and
trustworthy man, and the offspring they brought, were
blessings from Allah (#g)

so that they could occupy an

honourable position in the society.

Participation in the Construction of the Ka bah
Bayhaqi194 has reported that Allah inspired Ibrahim

to build

a House for Him. He felt constricted about it. So Allah sent him

194 Dala'il An-Nubuwwah by Bayhaqi (2/55). Tabari reported it in his Tafsir (3/
69-71), and Hakim in Al-Mustadrak (2/292-293) and said:

Sahih according

to Muslim's conditions." Dhahabi agreed to that. Azruqi reported it in the
Tarikh Makkah (1/24-25).

The Prophet of Islam

Sakinah (tranquility) which came in the form of a strong gale that
had a head. It went and settled itself in the place where the House
was to be built, coiling itself in the manner of a snake. As he began
to construct he raised a foot or so every day. When he reached the
point that is now occupied by Al-Hajr Al-Aswad (the Black Stone), he
asked his son for a rock. He looked around and found a suitable
rock. Then, all of a sudden he discovered that a stone was already in
place. His son asked, "Where did you get that from?" He replied,
"One who did not like to depend on your construction brought it.
Jibril brought it from the heavens." And so Ibrahim

completed

the construction.
Bayhaqi195 has another report of similar meaning in which he
adds that when the House fell down, the Amalekites rebuilt it.
When it fell down a second time, the Jurham tribe rebuilt it. The
Prophet sH was then a young man. When they wished to pull the old
building down, a snake appeared on top of its wall, driving fear into
their hearts. So the Quraysh assembled together and prayed to Allah
that He remove this obstacle. Allah ($g) sent a bird that snatched the
snake from the wall and flew away towards the Ajyad mountains.
The event reassured the Quraysh that they could demolish the old
building for a new construction.196 However, when construction
began and the time came for lifting the Black Stone to its place,
differences arose over who should do it. Finally they agreed that
they would accept the mediation of the first person to appear next
day from a certain direction. It was the Prophet

who appeared

first. He ruled that they place the Stone on a sheet which was lifted
by all the tribes.197

195 Dala'il An-Nubuwwah by Bayhaqi (2/56, 57) and Hakim reported it in his
Mustadrak (1/458) and declared it trustworthy while Dhahabi approved
it.
196 This is part of a Hadith narrated by 'Abdur-Razzaq in his Musannaf (5/
102/H. 9106). Dhahabi said in the Sir at, p. 77: “This is a Sahih report."
Dhahabi also reported close to it in his Sirat, p. 77, through Muhammad
bin Kathir Masisi through a Sound (Sahih) chain.
197 This is the completion of a Hadith in Bayhaqi's Dald'il An-Nubuwwah (2/
56, 57). Hakim also traced it in his Mustadrak (1/458) declaring it Sahih
with Dhahabi approving it.

From Birth to Emigration

137

Imam Ahmad198 and the biographers199 have reported that
when the Quraysh differed among themselves over the placement of
the Black Stone, someone suggested, "Appoint an arbiter." They
agreed to the suggestion and said, "Let the first man appearing from
this gorge be your arbiter." It so happened that the Prophet j|| was
the one to appear. They said, "The Trustworthy has shown up."
They presented the problem to him. He asked them to spread a
piece of cloth and place the Black Stone on it. Then he asked the
leaders of the tribes to lift the cloth. When they did that, he himself
placed the stone in its position.
If not for Allah's wisdom and His inspiration of the Prophet |g
to this solution, there could have been bloodshed200 on that
occasion. For it is reported that the differences over the Black Stone
took such a strong turn that the 'Abdud-Dar tribe brought forth a
bowl filled with blood and, along with Banu 'Adi, dipped their
fingers in the bowl, vowing death over the issue. Four or five days
passed without the Quraysh being able to reach an agreement until
the ordeal was resolved by the Prophet.201

198 Al-Musnad (3/425) from a Hadith narrated by Sa'ib bin 'Abdullah through
a chain different from that of Ibn Ishaq. Albani said its chain is Good
(Hasan) in footnotes of Fiqhus-Sirali by Ghazali, p. 84. Hakim too declared
its chain as Sound (Sahih) but Dhahabi made no comments. See Al-FathurRabbani (20/200-201) where Hilal bin Khabbab is the narrator, who in his
old age had got mixed up with narrations. But it is supported by a Hadith
of 'Ali. Dhahabi reported it in his Sirat, p. 68 and in Dald'il An-Nubuwivah
by Bayhaqi (2/57), from a Hadith narrated by Zuhri through a Discon¬
nected (Mursal) chain-in which it is mentioned that this happened after
the Prophet & had reached maturity! In this manner that report would
prove true which speaks of the Prophet & settling the issue when the
Quraysh differed over laying of the Black Stone.

The Prophet of Islam

When they had raised the walls, Allah (M) sent along a ship
from the Roman lands. It broke up near Jeddah. The Quraysh went
up to get some of its wood. They found a Roman carpenter near by.
They took his permission to take the wood and hired him to make
the roof for the Ka'bah.202
'Abdur-Razzaq203 and Ibn Ishaq204 are quite sure that the
Prophet ^ was then around thirty-five years old. That's the accepted
opinion,-03 although a minority view is that he was twenty-five.206
Some have said that he was still a boy207 (which of course is a weak
opinion since he hadn't still been nicknamed 'the Trustworthy').

When the Prophet

was given a share in an affair that the

Makkans considered so important, it was as if to allow him to play
a part in every affair of importance, putting to use a variety of
qualities that he possessed. That would have demonstrated that
he was capable of solving problems of various kinds, especially
those that required display of the qualities of truth and justice. His
part in the construction of the Ka'bah and solution to the
intractable problem that the Quraysh were facing and which
could have led to bloodshed, was one of those events that helped
the Prophet

gain experience in the real field of life and action.^

Corroborations by the People of the Book and the Arab
Soothsayers closed as the time of the Appearance arrived
Ibn Ishaq209 has a whole chapter on the prophecies concerning
the Prophet j|g by the Arab, Christian and Jewish soothsayers, priests
and monks to the effect that the time of his appearance had arrived.
One such prophecy made by Arab soothsayers has come
through a trustworthy chain terminating with Ibn 'Abbas. It speaks
about the jinns being unable to gather the hitherto heavenly news
because of fiery bodies hurled at them.210 Another prophecy was
from Sawad bin Qarib, the soothsayer who spoke to 'Umar. He said,
"The devils felt humiliated and overtaken by disappointment before
the Prophet's commissioning."211 His own entry into Islam was due

6-7) Also see Bayhaqi in Daid'll An-Nubuwwah (2/248-254) with a chain
that continues up to Bara' bin 'Azib. See also the footnote of the two
redactors of Sirat Ibn Hisham (1/268).

The Prophet of Islam

to his observations through soothsaying practices in which the jinn
were invoked 212
Ibn Ishaq213 has another narration to the effect that a Jew lived
in the neighbourhood of Banu 'Abdul-Ashhal. He spoke to them
about Resurrection, Reckoning, etc. They refused to believe in him
and asked him for evidence. He told them that a Prophet was about
to be raised from some place around the land. He pointed in the
direction of Makkah and Yemen.
Another report from Ibn Ishaq214 discusses the reason of entry
into Islam of a few persons named as ThaTabah bin Sa'yah, Usayd
bin Sa'yah and Asad bin 'Ubayd. They were all Jews of the Banu
Hadal, the brothers of Banu Qurayzah. A Jew called Ibn Hayban
had prophesied the Prophet

He had come down from Sham and

had settled in Madinah a few years before the Prophet ^ was
commissioned. He had come down hoping to catch up with the man
that was destined to be commissioned and to follow him. He invited
the Jews to do the same and warned them that no one should beat
them on that. He told them about some of his signs. When the Banu
Qurayzah forts were surrounded, these individuals embraced Islam.
In Salman Farisi's story is also a proof that a Prophet was being

"12 Ibn Hajar: Al-Fath (15/25), Bayhaqi in Dalail An-Nubuwwah (2/249-251).
“13 Ibn Hisham (1/270) with a Continuous (Muttasil) chain and trustworthy
narrators. Ibn Ishaq reported this Hadith and it is Hasan. More than one scholar
has recorded this Hadith through Ibn Ishaq, for example: Ahmad (3/467),
Haythami in Al-Majma' (8/230), and Abu Nu'aym: Ad-Dala'il (1/74-75), Bayhaqi:
Dalail An-Nubuwwah (2/78-79), and Hakim: Al-Mustadrak (3/417-418). See also
Sirat of Dhahabi, p. 74. All of them treated this report as Sound (Sahih).
214 The story is mentioned by Ibn Ishaq with an Interrupted (.Munqati')
chain — Ibn Hisham (1/272), as also in Dald'il of Abu Nu'aym (1/81) and in
Bayhaqi's Dalail (2/80-81). Both of them reported through Ibn Ishaq.
However, Ibn Sa'd (1/160) traced it through Waqidi. This story gained
strength because of conjunctive reports and can be used for scholarly
purposes. For, Bukhari and Muslim pointed out in their Sahih that some of
the Jews of Banu Qurayzah joined the Prophet gg and he gave them
amnesty, and they converted to Islam. See: Al-Bukhari/Al-Fath (15/203/H.
4028 and Muslim (3/1388/H. 1766), as well as Sunan of Abu Dawud (2/
140-141) and Abu 'Awanah in his Musnad (4/163). See Sindi's treatise:

awaited. Salman had left his lands in search of Truth. He was taken
prisoner and brought to Madinah.215 The story of Waraqah bin
Nawfal and Zayd bin 'Amr bin Nufayl is also well-known. They
had left Makkah looking for the true religion until they met a monk
in Mosul. He told Zayd that the person he was searching for was
likely to appear in the lands around. 16
These prophecies are proof that the Prophet's advent was
awaited. It were the attributes of the Prophet j|| that Salman Farisi
had learnt from them that led him to Islam.
Trustworthy reports say that when Allah ($g) wished Zayd bin
Su'nah, the Jewish scholar, to believe, he said, "None of the signs of the
prophethood are left but I recognize them in Muhammad's face when
I look up at him, except for two of them that I have not yet seen. One,
his quality of clemency getting the better of his misdemeanour, and
two, misdemeanor against him should only increase his attribute of
clemency." So he interacted with the Prophet % to assure himself of
J

•

the presence of these two qualities.

217

215 See the whole story by Ibn Ishaq who traced it with a Hasan chain -Ibn
Hisham (1/273-282). Bukhari on the other hand has mentioned how the
Prophet m directed Salman to free himself through a contract -Al-Bukhari/
Al-Fath (9/280/The Book of Buyu'). Nevertheless, it is a Suspended
(Mu'allaq) report. But more than one has reported through Ibn Ishaq. See
the footnote of Ibn Hisham (1/282), and Ibn Hajar: Al-Fath (9/280). Ibn
Hajar said at that point: "It has been reported by Ibn Hibban and Hakim
in their Sahih through a different chain, tracing it through Zayd bm Suhan,
through Salman reported something similar. It was also reported by A u
Ahmad, Abu Y'ala, and Hakim as a Hadith of Buraydah of similar
meaning."
216 The whole story is reported by Hakim in his Mustadrak (3/439) and
mentioned that it is Sahih. Also in Abu Dawud Tayalisi: Tartibul-Banna

not report. It is in fact a bright report. Haythami in tasJVfajmw (8/2 )
said: "The reporters of Tabarani were trustworthy ones. Ibn Hajar said m

The Prophet of Islam

We also have the report of 'Amir bin Rabi'ah 'Adawi. He was
on the same religion as that of Zayd bin 'Amr bin Nufayl who used
to say that he was waiting for the sons of Isma'il to produce a
Prophet named Ahmad by the children of 'Abdul-Muttalib. He
didn't think he was going to see him. He used to talk to his people
about the signs that he had learnt from the People of the Book.21s
Qus bin Sa'idah 'Iyadi used to say, "Qus swears over something
which involves no sin. Allah has no religion on earth dearer to Him
than the religion whose advent is close. Good news then to him who
found it and embraced it. And woe unto him who found it but did
not embrace it."219
The commentators of the Qur'an have said in reference to the Verse:

Al-Isabah (1/548): "The narrators of chain were trustworthy. Walid bin
Muslim asserted the narration. Its dependence is on Muhammad bin Abu
Sirri, who has been identified as Muhammad bin Mutawakkil, and who
has been treated as trustworthy by Ibn Ma'in while Abu Hatim declared
weak."
2IXSee the story in Al-Fath (14/297/H. 2826) and Ibn Su'd (1/161), and said
the two redactors of Dalai1 of Abu Nu'aym (1/100) regarding the chain of
Ibn Hajar: "It appears that the chain cited by him is acceptable because he
placed a condition at the introduction of the book Al-Fath that he will not
mention a Hadith unless there was enough proof of its authenticity or of
its being Hasan. (Hadyus-Sdri, 1/16), and Suyuti: Al-Khasd'is (1/61).
219 See the story in Dala’il of Abu Nu'aym (1/104-105) and what the two
verifiers said while reporting the story: "Suyuti said in his book Al-Khasd’is
(and I found the story in the narration of Ibn Sa'd bin Abu Waqqas and
reported by Imam Muhammad bin Dawud Zahiri in his book Az-Zuhrah)...
he said there, "We were reported..." and mentioned the Hadith. Then he
added, "It is one of the best of narrations." It is understandable from their
verification of the report that it is of Hasan chain. See it also in Dala'il AnNubuwwah by Bayhaqi (1/101-104) although its attribution has been
questioned. See what we said about Al-Hunafa' in the foreword to this
book in our study of Qus bin Sa'idah.

From Birth to Emigration

“When a Book came to them acknowledging that which is with
them (of the Scriptures) - although they used to seek victory220
over the disbelievers, but, when that came which they were able to
recognize, they disbelieved. So Allah s curse be on the
disbelievers,"
that it was revealed in reference to the Jews. They were locked in
struggle with the Aws and Khazraj tribes. When the two tribes
defeated them in a battle; they would say: "The time of the Last
Messenger's appearance is close. We shall fight against you along
with him and slaughter you the way 'Ad and Iram were
slaughtered." Nevertheless, when the Prophet % appeared, Aws
and Khazraj believed in him but the Jews refused.222
Abu Sufyan's encounter with Heraclius and the long conversa¬
tion that took place between them points to the same truth; especially
Heraclius' words to Abu Sufyan: "If what you say is true then, surely,
he will one day occupy the land under my feet."

Hadith literature also confirms that it was written in the
previous Scriptures that Muhammad #| was designated to be a
Prophet from very early times. Imam Ahmad "

and Iirmiani

have a report to this effect. It says, "I was a Prophet while Adam
was still between body and soul." Ahmad

has a Hadith (tradition)

220 They used to seek Allah's help by him for victory upon Arab polytheists.

(1/70), but it gets stronger through other reports. And of those that can be
stated in support is one narrated by Salamah bin Salamah in connection
with the story of Bani 'Abdul-Ashhal Jews. It is graded as Hasan li Dhdtihi.
See Marwwiyyatu Tdriki' Yahudil-Madinah, p. 49, and Tafsir At-Tabar,

was still in his dust." Abu Nu'aym227 has another report which says,
"I was the first Prophet in creation but the last to be raised."

Wisdom

1.

In short, the Jewish and Christian scholars knew about the
likely appearance of a Prophet, before Muhammad

was

commissioned. The knowledge had its basis in his qualities, and
the time of his commissioning that was mentioned in Tawrah
and Injil. The Qur'an has also thrown hints of this in several
places.

Following these predictions, some of the Jews

277 Dala'il An-Nubuimah of Bayhaqi (1/42). In his Al-Jami'us-Saghir, Suvuti
mentioned that it is Sahih, Manawi agreed with him.
However, the two verifiers of Bayhaqi's Dala'il said that Manawi did not
agree with Suyuti over its reliability. Dr. Muhammad bin Lutfi Sabbagh
said in his notes on Maqasidul-Hasanah of Suyuti (H. 774) that his
declaration of reliability needs a re-check. For, it has Baqiyyah in its chain
about whom Ibn Mubarak said, “He is reliable, but one has to be careful
to note whom he takes from and whom he narrates to." Abu Hatim said
that he was not to be used for scholarly works. Abu Misfar said that
Baqiyyah's narratives were not clear enough. See Mizdn (2/128). Also,
there is another narrator called Sa'eed bin Bashir whom Ibn Ma'in and
others declared weak. See Mizdn (2/128), Maqdsid 327, Tamyiz 122, Asrdr
272, Kashf 2/192, Durar no. 337, Shawkani's Fawa’id 326 and Ibn Kathir's
Tafsir (6/383) who said, “Sa'eed bin Bashir was weak."
228 For example. Verse 146 of Surat Al-Baqarah: “Those to whom We gave the
Scripture (Jews and Christians) recognize him as they recognize their sons.
But verily, a party of them conceals the truth while they know it." And
Verse 20 of Surat Al-An'am: “Those to whom We have given the Scripture
(Jews and Christians) recognize him as they recognize their own sons.
Those who destroyed themselves will not believe." And Verse 6 of Surat
As-Saff. “And remember when 'Isa (Jesus) son of Maryam (Mary) said, 'O
Children of Israel! I am the Messenger unto you, confirming the Tawrah
(Torah) which came before me, and giving glad tidings of a Messenger to
come after me, whose name shall be Ahmad." And Verse 157 of Surat AlA rdf: Ihose who follow the Messenger, the Prophet who can neither read
nor write (i.e., Muhammad about) whom they find written in the Torah
and the Gospel." And Verse 89 of Surat Al-Baqarah: “And when there
came to them (the Jews), a Book (this Qur'an) from Allah confirming what

From Birth to Emigration

145

embraced Islam. 'Abdullah bin Sallam was the first of them.
Some Christians also embraced Islam, Najashi preceding
everyone. What prevented some others from accepting Islam
were material or political reasons. Huyay bin Akhtab, Heraclius
and the Egyptian Bishop are examples.
2.

What we have earlier written while discussing the Prophet's
journey to Sham might once again be recalled here.

Reclusion in the Hira’ Cave
The Prophet

used to seek reclusion in the Hira' cave seeking

closeness with Allah (3g). That was made dear to him, although after
the commissioning he didn't order anyone to follow his example. He
used to frequently spend several days and nights: until the
revelation

came to him. He was then forty.

He stayed in Hira' a month or so every year. As Ibn Ishaq231
reports, the Quraysh also practiced this ascetic seclusion in preIslamic times. During those days he also fed poor travelers passing
by his temporary hermitage. And, after he had completed the one
month period, the first thing he did before going home was to pay
homage to Ka'bah.232
Scholars have differed amongst themselves over the devotions:
were they following a religion or not? If yes, what religion? Some
have said that they were in accordance with Null's religion. Others
said they originated in Ibrahimic practices. This seems to be the

is with them (the Torah)."
229 See this meaning in 'Aishah's Hadith in Al-Bukhdri in the Book dealing
with the commencement of the Divine Revelation, the Book of the Stories
of the Prophet, the Book of Interpretation of Dreams, and others as
examples. Al-Bukhari/Al-Fath (26/204/H. 6982).
230From a Hadith reported by Al-Bukhari/Al-Fath (15/83/H. 3902).
231 See the report in Ibn Flisham's Sirat (1/298) - a narration of Ibn Ishaq
through a Hasan chain. In it is the evidence that worship of one God was
familiar in Makkah.
232 This was reported in a Hadith of Ibn Ishaq mentioned above through a
Hasan chain.

146

The Prophet of Islam

correct opinion. The fundamental principles and practices as
sanctioned by the religion of Musa and 'Isa
have also been
named. It is also said that the Prophet £| put to devotional practice
anything that he knew had a religious source. That said, this is not
the place to discuss this issue in detail.233

Signs before the Prophethood
'Aishah '4' said, "The first thing that the Prophet sgg experienced
was true dreams. He didn't see a dream but it turned out as true as
the dawn. Next, Allah endeared seclusion to him. He began to go to
Hira' for days together spending time in devotions. He carried
provision when he went. When it was over, he returned to Khadijah
and then, once again went back refurnished, until the revelation
came while he was in Hira'."234
It is also reported that he said, "I know the rock in Makkah that
used to greet me. I know it very well."235
It is reported too that on one occasion when he was in one of the
valleys of Makkah two angels came down to him. One of them said
to the other, "Weigh him against another man." So he weighed him.
Muhammad outweighed him. They kept on weighing him until he
proved to be heavier than a thousand men. At that, the other angel
said, "If you weighed him against his followers, he will outweigh
them all. Anyway, cut open his breast." The angel opened it and
removed from it Shay tan's share. He also removed a clot of blood
and threw it away. Then one of them told the other, "Wash the inner
parts with water, the way you wash a basin." The other complied.
Then he asked for Sakinah to be brought forth. His heart was
returned. The other commanded, "Stitch his breast." He did it.
Finally, they embossed the mark "Seal of Prophets" between his

233 Ibn Kathir: Al-Bidayah wan-Nihdyah (3/7).
234See Al-Bukhdri/Al-Fath (26/197-200/H. 6982), Muslim (1/139-140/H. 160),
and others. The version here is Muslim's.

shoulders. That done, they left. All this, while the Prophet H was
watching their actions.236
It is also reported that once he left Khadijah '&>. When he
returned, he told her that his breast had been opened, washed,
cleansed and made to return to what it was before. She remarked,
“This by God sounds good. So be of good cheer."237
The Prophet
also told Khadijah
"I see some light in the
heavens and hear some sounds. I am afraid I'll go crazy." She
assured him, "Allah will not do that to you, O 'Abdullah's son."
Then she took him to Waraqah bin Nawfal and told him about the
vision. He said, "If he is truthful then this is the same angel that had
come to Musa. If he is given prophethood in my lifetime. I'll help
him and believe in him."238

Lessons

1.

The signs and miracles that the Prophet ^ experienced show
that he was different from others of the devotional kind —the
Hanafites —that were his contemporaries; they also show that
Allah (4g) was to choose him for prophethood.

2.

They were to establish that true dreams are forty-sixth of
prophethood. We know that the total period of revelation was
23 years, of which first six months constituted of true dreams.

236 From a narration of Ibn 'Asakir. Ibn Kathir quoted from into his AlBiddyah wan-Nihdyah (2/299) also from a Hadith of Abu Dharr
Reported
by Bazzar as in Majma'uz-Zawd'id by Haythami (8/255). It has a weak
chain but which gathers strength from the report of Zuhri that follows.
237 Reported by Bayhaqi in Ad-Dald'il (2/142, 145-146) through two chains.
First through Zuhri. This is a Disconnected (Mursal) report. Another came
through Ibn Lahiy'ah, hq from Abul-Aswad and he through 'Urwah. This
too is a Mursal report. Thus both the chains are weak. Yet the two have
two other reports strengthening them: one of Ibn Asakir s Hadith and the
other of Bazzar. See Muhammad Suyani: Al-Qasimiyah: Dirdsatun Naqadiyatun li-Nusis Siratin-Nabawiyyah, (pp. 187-189).
238 Reported by Ahmad: Al-Fathur-Rabbdni (20/720) through a Good (Hasan)
chain from a Hadith of 'Ammar bin Abu 'Ammar.

148

The Prophet of Islam

3.

It is desirable for a Muslim to seek seclusion from the people
when moral corruptions become rampant in the world around
him. This might help him think freely, without normal
constraints to the thoughts. Permanent seclusion from the
people, that some people practice in our times, does not
conform with the Sunnah. It is not proven of the Prophet

that

he practiced seclusion of this sort. In fact, he said, "The believer
who interacts with the people bearing with patience the
inconveniences that they cause is better than him who does
not interact with them and does not bear with patience."239 He
also said, "A believer is amiable, easy to socialize. There is no
good in a man who is not amiable and who cannot be accessed.
The best of people is the one who is most beneficial to the
people."240

The First Revelation
The angel who brought revelation on a Monday, on the 21st of
Ramadan,241 at the age of forty, in the Hira' Cave, took the Prophet

5H by surprise. He bid him, "Read." It is reported that the Prophet

239 Ahmad: Al-Musnad (7/94/Shakir). Shakir said: "Its chain is Sahih."
Albani: Sahih Sunan Ibn Mdjah (2/307/H. 4032) and added: Sahih, and
drew attention to its cataloguing in Mishkdt no. 5087, and (his own)
Silsilatul-Ahadithus-Sahihah, no. 939.
Albani: Sahih Sunan At-Tirmidhi (2/307) - Chapters describing the Day of
Judgment/H. 2638). Albani added: Sahih. Bukhari also recorded it in AlAdabul-Mufrad, no. 58.
240 Suyuti: Al-Jami'us-Saghir (2/184) and said: Reported by Daraqutni, and it
is Sahih.
241 This has been clearly declared in a Verse, "The month of Ramadan in which
was revealed the Qur'an,” Surat Al-Baqarah: 185. And in a Hadith in Muslim
(2/819/H. 1162.) in which Monday is specified. See: Ibn Hisham (1/304)
where Ibn Ishaq said it was in Ramadan and cited Qur'anic Verses apart
from the above, and Ahmad's Musnad (b/297, 299) and As-Sunan Al-Kubra
by Bayhaqi (4/293). The scholars differed over a specific date; while
Mubarkpuri (in his Ar-Rahiq), through his footnote no. 2, p. 68, gave
preference to the 21st something only he did, so far as my knowledge
goes.

From Birth to Emigration

149

HI said, "I said, 'I do not know how to read/ He held me and
pressed me hard against himself. Then, letting me go he repeated,
'Read.' I gave him the same answer, 'I don't know how to read.' He
seized me once again and pressed me hard against himself. And
then, letting me go he repeated his behest. I told him once again that
I couldn't. So he seized me a third time and pressed me hard against
himself. Then letting me go he said, 'Read by the name of your Lord'
until the words, 'what he did not know.'" 'Aishah 4, the narrator
said, "He returned to Khadijah much disturbed. He said, 'Cover me
up.' They covered him with a blanket until he recovered. He said,
'Khadijah, I don't know what's happening.' Then he repeated all
that had happened concluding, 'I'm afraid of myself.' Khadijah said,
'By God, He will not waste you. You join the kin, speak the truth,
unburden others, and help in virtuous matters.' Later, she took him
to Waraqah bin Nawfal bin Asad bin 'Abdul-'Uzza, her uncle. He
had turned Christian in pre-Islamic times. He was capable of writing
the Scriptures in the Hebrew language. He was pretty old, and
blind. She told him, 'Listen to what your nephew has to say.' He
asked, 'My dear nephew. What is it that you see?' He narrated the
whole story. When he was through, Waraqah said, 'This is the same
angel who had come down to Musa. May that I am alive the day
they will exile you.' The Prophet exclaimed, 'Will they exile me?'
Waraqah replied, 'Yes. No one ever brought what you have brought
but he was antagonized and persecuted. If I am alive that day, I
shall help you and strengthen you.' But it was not long before
Waraqah died."242
With regard to the report by Ibn Ishaq243 about how the
revelation started, in which he said, "Jibril came to me while I was
sleeping. He brought me a book in a brocaded silken cloth, telling
me to read." This report seems to contradict the one in the Sahihayn
narrated by 'Aishah 4. That report asserts that he was awake when
Jibril came and that tru£ dreams had preceded it. Suhayli244 has.

242 Al-Bukhari/Al-Fath (26/204/H. 6982), and Muslim (1/139-140/H. 160);
Ahmad: Al-Fathur-Rabbani (18/47).
243 Sirat Ibn Hisham, (1/299-302) through a Good (Hasan) chain.
244 Ar-Rawdul-Unuf (1/269).

150

therefore, said, "It is possible to reconcile the two in the following
manner: Jibril first came when the Prophet j|§ was asleep, before
coming to him when he was awake, in order to make him get used
to it and make it easy for him to bear it. prophethood after all is a big
affair, whose burden is heavy and man is created weak.
Ibn Kathir seconds this opinion adding his own remark, "The
account of the 'Prophet's Battles' as written by Musa bin 'Uqbah and
as narrated by Zuhri has in fact a statement to the effect that the
Prophet #§ first saw Jibril in a dream and subsequently while
awake." He wrote in another place,245 "It is also possible that he
experienced the night vision after he had seen him while awake. It
could have also happened later, after some time."

Lessons
1.

Khadijah's attitude toward the first revelation speaks of her
intelligence and is proof of her uncorrupted nature, and
excellent moral qualities.

2.

From the manner of Waraqah's advice, his religious knowledge
stands confirmed as of the right kind.

3.

The Prophet's vision of Jibril with his eyes is a proof that
revelation is not the name of an internal inspiration or
something of that order. It is rather an act of giving and
receiving, which has external physical manifestations. It has
nothing to do with the internal condition. The angel's act of
pressing the Prophet #g against himself and then the behest that
he read, demonstrate that it was an external affair which
disproves any idea that it was an imagination.

4.

The Prophet's expression of fear at the receipt of the first
revelation contains the proof that he wasn't expecting to be

245 Al-Bidayah wan-Nihdyah (3/504), the narration of Ibn 'Uqbah has been
quoted by Ibn Kathir in (another place in) Al-Bidayah wan-Nihayah (3/1415).

From Birth to Emigration

151

made a Prophet and commissioned to confront the world. This
should also lead to believe that the revelation had not come to
confirm an already existing inner feeling. Rather, he was taken
by complete surprise. It rules out the allegation made by the
Orientalists that it was something building up in his heart and
mind, which gradually led to a firm internal conviction that he
was raised as a Prophet.
5.

It was in Allah's power to send peace to Muhammad's heart
and give him assurance that the person he had encountered was
none other than Jibril, an angel from Him. But, it seems Allah
(■§£) willed that there should be a line drawn to distinguish
between the two personalities of Muhammad: one before and
the other after he was commissioned as a Messenger. It was also
to impress that the faith and beliefs that he projected later, had
not been in generation in his mind before he was thus selected
and that he had never imagined that one day he would be
inviting other people to them.

6.

In the inspiration that triggered in Khadijah's heart, to take the
Prophet to Waraqah, there was another confirmation that this
new phenomenon that the Prophet

had experienced was the

very revelation that countless Prophets had received earlier. It
also helped remove from him the doubts that weighed heavily
on him.246
7. If the revelation was the making of the inner self, he would not
have been censured over some of his minor and almost
inconsequential failures.
8. Had the revelation been his own making, he would not have
received such Verses as:

246 See Buti: Fiqhus-Sirah, pp. 68-70.

The Prophet of Islam

152

"Therefore, if you are in any doubt over what We have revealed

unto you then inquire with those who recite the Scripture of
earlier times. Surely, the truth has come to you from your Lord,
therefore, be not of those who bear doubt."
9.

If revelation had been the work of his own imagination, the
Prophet j|| would not have waited for long or short periods to
answer questions that were asked and which he could not
immediately answer. Nor would he have suffered in conse¬
quence of certain events, such as the event of slander against his
wife, when he suffered for a whole month, waiting for the
revelation to come down.

10. Allah's wisdom required that His Messenger sl| should be
unlettered, who knew neither how to read nor how to write.
This was to remove any lingering doubt about the Qur'an.
Allah said:
ot

Ujf

"And before this, you hadn't read a book nor wrote a line with
your right hand that the doubters should doubt."249

The Period of Cessation and Resumption of Revelation
After the first revelation Jibril held back for a while. There are
several opinions about the period involved."4} It is generally said
that Bayhaqi's opinion of six months' cessation sounds weighty. It is
also said that nearest to being correct is the opinion of Ibn 'Abbas

247 Surat Yunus: 94. Like the French Caradovuo. See: Hadirul- Alamil-Islami (1/
39).
248 Surat Al-'Ankabut: 48.
249 Fiqhus-Sirah, p. 67. He did not mention its position in two of Bayhaqi's
books: Ad-Dald'il or As-Sunan Al-Kubra, or others. What we find in AsSunan Al-Kubra, (9/6) is that the revelation discontinued. That the period
was six months was not stated.

From Birth to Emigration

153

that it lasted forty days 230 In fact, some have said that it wasn't
more than a few days.
In any case, the Prophet ^ was disturbed by the cessation, to
the extent that some biographers thought he wished to throw
himself down a cliff.251 Albani252 has pointed out that this is not a

Hadith, rather a statement of Zuhri. It is against the character and
personality that Messengers are endowed with.
Nevertheless, after a short or long gap, the revelation came to
him a second time. The Prophet s|g himself said about it, "While I
was walking I heard a voice from the heavens. I raised my eyes and
lo, the angel that had come to me in Hira' the first time, was sitting
on a chair which was as large as to cover the space between the
earth and the heaven. I was over-awed. I returned and told them,
'Cover me, cover me.' Allah revealed

"O you who covers himself up. Rise and warn...' until, 'And

shun the abominable."
Thereafter revelation came down at a regular pace."253

Wisdom in the Cessation

1.

It was so arranged that following the confirmation that he had
been chosen a Messenger, the Prophet's thirst for revelation
should be aroused.

250 See Zurqani's Sharhul-Mawdhibil-Ladunniyyah (1/236). He mentioned all the
statements that were issued on this issue. However, he did not mention a
strong basis for the opinions of the scholars for one to argue with, see
Shami: Min Ma'inis-Sirah^p. 29.
251 Al-Bukhari/Al-Fath (26/204-205/H. 6982).

(18/48-49).

154

The Prophet of Islam

2.

In the cessation and then resumption of the revelation is the
proof, as we wrote earlier, that it was not the Prophet's own
making.

Kinds of Revelation
Ibn Qaiyim254 wrote: Of the many kinds of revelations, Allah
($i) chose a few for His Prophet. First, is true dreams. This was the
method adopted in the beginning as 'Aishah's report demonstrates.
She said, "The first thing that happened to the Prophet $| was that
he began to experience true dreams. So that, he didn't see a dream
but it proved as true as the dawn."255
Second, what his heart received directly from the angel without
being able to see him. The Prophet #§ said, "The Ruhul-Qudus (Jibril)
has revealed unto my heart that no soul will die before receiving its
full share of providence. Therefore, adopt honorable means in
obtaining your share."256
Third, the angel came in human form and spoke to him until he
had heard and understood the revelation. In such situations the

254 Zadul-Ma'ad (1/78-80). Also see Baghawi's Sharhus-Sunnah (13/321) and
Muhammad Rasulullah by 'Urjun (1/278).
255Al-Bukhdri/Al-Fath (26/204-207/H. 6982), Muslim (1/139/H. 160), Ahmad:
Al-Fathur-Rabbani (18/47).
256 This Hadith gathers strength through others of similar kind. Albani has
reported it in his footnotes in Fiqhus-Sirah by Ghazali, p. 96. He said: "This
is a Sahih Hadith that has come through different sources: The first one by
Ibn Mas'ud, reported by Hakim (2/4) and the second through Ibn Abu
Umamah, recorded by Tabarani in Al-Kabir and Abu Nu'aym in HilyatulAwliya' (10/26, 27). and a third through Hudhaifah recorded by Bazzar as
in At-Targhib. (3/7) and Haythami in Majma'uz-Zawaid (4/71). These
variety of sources strengthen each other, which therefore and Allah knows
best —led Ibn Qaiyim to attribute it, in Iris Zadul-Ma'ad, to the Prophet
And it was also traced by the two verifiers of Zad: Shu'ayb and 'AbdulQadir Arna'ut (1/79). They agree with Albani in treating this report
because of others. They too mentioned the supporting reports that Albani
mentioned adding their own, viz., the Hadith of Jabir
recorded in Ibn
Majah (2144) and Ibn Hibbdn (1084 and 1085).

Companions also saw the angel as a human.257
Fourth, sometimes revelation came in the manner of ringing
bells. This was the hardest of the several kinds. In this situation the
angel enwrapped him completely. His forehead sweated on a
severely cold day and, if he was riding a beast, it collapsed to the
ground.258
Fifth, he saw the angel in the very form and shape in which he
has been created. The angel then revealed what Allah (ffi) desired to
be revealed. This happened to him twice as stated in Surat An-

Najm.259
Sixth, what Allah revealed to him when he was in the heavens
during his night journey and ascension (Al-lsra' ival-Mi'raj),
commanding him five daily prayers and a few other things.
Seventh, Allah speaking out to him directly, without the angel's
mediation, as He spoke to Musa, the son of 'Imran. The Qur'an
stated:

"And Allah spoke to Musa, directly."260
Another evidence comes from the Prophet

himself when he

spoke of his night journey and ascension. He said, "Then I was
taken up until I reached a level from where I could hear the sound of
the Pens."261

257 As in a Hadith in which the Prophet ^ said to 'Umar
"'Umar, do you
know who was the questioner?" 'Umar replied: "Allah and his Messenger
know best." The Prophet sH said: "That was Jibril who came to teach you
your religion." See Muslim (1/36-37/H. 8.), The two redactors of Zad said
that Nasa'i reported with a Sahih chain that Jibril used to come in the
figure of Dihyah Kalbi.

3215 ), and Muslim (4/1816/H. 2333) and others.

Stages in the Call
Ibn Qaiyim262 has mentioned five stages: First, prophethood;
second, warning the closest of the kin; third, warning his own
people; fourth, warning those to whom no Messenger had been sent
earlier, i.e., the Peninsula Arabs; and fifth, warning all those who are
ever likely to receive the message — until the end of the world.

Stages of the Call during the Life of the Prophet #|263
First stage: Secret calling. It lasted three years.
Second stage: Open calling: but forbidden to fight. It lasted until
the emigration to Madinah.
Third stage: Open calling: allowed to fight those who initiated a
fight. It lasted until the Hudaybiyah expedition.
Fourth stage: Open calling. Fighting against anyone who stood
as a barrier.

Understanding the Stages
A question might be asked: Is it necessary for those engaged in
the work of establishing Islam, especially in the contemporary
world, that they should follow these stages with the same time
schedule as happened during the life of the Prophet #§? The answer
is no. They are not required to follow the same stages,264 nor are
they required to have the same time schedule. Those stages and the
periods involved were determined by Allah (5®). They were not the
result of human design.265 Any predetermination of stages in the

262 Zadul-Ma'ad (1/86).
263 See Buti: Fiqhus-Sirah, p. 57, Mubarakpuri: Ar-Rahiq Al-Makhtum, p. 84.
264 See Zuhayr Salim: 'Atharat wa Saqatat fi Kitdbul-Manhajul-Haraki lis-SiratinNabawiyyah, p. 29 and the following pages; and the book is a careful study
of the understanding of Islamic movements from the perspective of the
Sirat, and a successful effort of Shaykh Ghadban in his pioneering book.
265 See Munir Ghadban: Al-Manhajul-Haraki lis-Siratin-Nabawiyyah, p. 9. The
book invites the Islamic callers for an open discussion over the formation

From Birth to Emigration

157

Islamic solutions to later day problems will not agree with the
ground situation then prevalent. They should keep before them the
life of the Prophet ^ as a role model, which contains several
examples to choose from. Secrecy, or seeking help (from the
outlying tribes), or emigration, are but some of the means that the
Prophet jig resorted to for his mission, in circumstances that were
special to him. For instance, in our times we find that the democratic
states of the West do not place any hurdle before the efforts to
propagate Islam. Therefore, secrecy is not required to be main¬
tained. While, on the other hand, the communist world did not
permit any religious activity. In such climates it was imperative to
observe secrecy. Alternatively, if the call requires that some affairs
be kept open while others secret, then, that would be allowable. This
can be the case with countries where the governments do not allow
complete freedom to the Islamic movements.
In short, the amount of secrecy to be observed is something that
should be determined by those engaged in the call in accordance
with the situations prevalent.266

The First Phase: Secret Call
The Prophet

responded to the Divine commandments that

required him to openly proclaim the message he had received. These
commandments were quite unequivocal. For example.

of the fundamental principles for the methods to be adopted by Islamic
movements.
266 See Zuhayr Salim: The previous reference pp. 28 35, where he argues
against Shaykh Ghadban who maintained that the secret phase is necessary.
It appears that Ghadban based his discussion upon some tyrannical
regimes and overlooked what is happening in most of the Western
countries, eventually he was not successful when he generalized the rule.
See Dr. Buti, Fiqhus-Sirah, pp. 76-77.

The Prophet of Islam

158

"O you who wraps himself in the blanket, rise and warn; your

Lord exalt, your clothes keep clean, and shun the abominable.
And do not give seeking increase. And be patient for your
Lord."267
These Verses carry the commandment to preach the mission
that he was entrusted with. And, since the Verses were revealed
early in Makkah, by implication they left out those outside it.
The choice of words, "O you who wraps himself in the blanket,”
means that the time when the Prophet |§ could comfortably wrap
himself in a blanket and leisurely pass his time with wife and
children had passed. The time for struggle with all the powers of the
body and material resources had dawned.
The words, "rise and warn," command him to warn everyone
around. The words, "your Lord exalt," mean that he was to convey to
the people that there was nothing greater than the Lord before
whom the people should humble themselves. This is a demand of

Tawhid on the slaves of God.
In the words, "your clothes keep clean,” is the message that it is
necessary for the caller to outwardly and inwardly keep himself
clean in order to be an example for those he is invoking to
cleanliness in its fullest sense.
In the words, "shun the abominable" is the hint that unadulterated

Tawhid demands that one reject purity and sacredness of everything
else, so that the Creator alone might be venerated.
The words "do not give seeking increase" tell us that it is
forbidden that any favor be done, or anything be given in the hope
of getting back more than given. Another message is that the
caller —who calls to a supreme set of morals — should himself be
adorned with the best of moral qualities.
And, in order to achieve the above, it was necessary that the
directives issued should be followed by an injunction concerning an
important practical principle, viz., patience and perseverance. They
are required in the face of all kinds of difficulties that the adversaries
present. In fact, patience is required to deal with those also who

159

respond positively, as well as when the caller is faced with trials and
tribulations.
Accordingly, the Prophet #§ rose up from his bed to begin
inviting, observing secrecy as Ibn Ishaq268 has stated. His words are,
“The Prophet concealed his mission for three years until he was
ordered to make an open call." The report of 'Amr bin 'Abasah
also strengthens this. He said, "I went to see the Prophet ig right at
the start of his mission at Makkah. He was then concealing (his
mission)."261 The Prophet i|§ began with the invitation to Tawhid,
and shunning of every practice that had polytheistic leanings.
In this stage he restricted his call to those he was closely related:
his wife, children, slaves, foster son, friends, and eveiyone about
whom he was sure he would keep the affair confidential.270 That is
why we see that the earliest of those to believe in him are:
1)

His wife Khadijah ^>: She was the first to believe in him. She
made his mission easy for him. Hence she was the first to
receive the glad tiding of Paradise. The Prophet jig said, "I was
asked to give Khadijah the tiding of a palace in Paradise made
of a single pearl, in which there will be no noise and where
nothing unseemly will happen."271 There are several reports
that speak of the good qualities of this lady.272

of Khadijah's early Islam.
273 Ibn Ishaq reported in his Sirat, p. 137, being a narration of Yunus bin
Bukayr and through a Hasan chain which leads to the belief that 'Ali
was the first youth to get into Islam. See the report that tells of the
conversation between Afif and Abbas when he came for trading. He saw

His freed-slave Zayd bin Harithah

When his father had gone

to claim him, the Prophet 5l| gave him the choice," If y ou wish you
can live with me. But if you wish to go with your father, you are
free to do so/'274 Zayd chose to stay with him and was known as
Zayd bin Muhammad until Allah revealed the following Verse:

"Call them (adopted sons) by (the names of) their fathers. That is
more just with Allah."275
the Prophet ^ leaving for Ka'bah to pray there, and was joined by his
wife Khadijah and his cousin 'Ali bin Abu Talib. 'Afif said, "I wish I had
believed then and there and become the second in Islam meaning the
second male. This narration of Yunus bin Bukayr is in Dala il by Bayhaqi
(2/162-63). Dr. Qala'ji said when reporting this Hadith: “A Saltih Hadith,
Bukhari reported it in At-Tdrikh Al-Kabir and Ibn Kathir in At-Tdrikh, and
Hakim in Al-Mustadrak where he said: 'This Hadith has a Sahih chain
although the Shaykhayn did not record it/ Dhahabi agreed to this. Tabari
reported it in At-Tdrikh and Ibn Abdul-Barr in Al-Isti'ab. Haythami said in
the Majma' (9/103) that Ahmad reported it, Abu Ya'la and Tabarani
through various chains; and Ahmad's narrators are reliable." The report
concerning his Islam was reported by Ibn Ishaq through an Interrupted
(Munqati') chain-Ibn Hishdm (1/312-314), and by Ibn Sayyidin-Nas in
'Uyunul-Athar (1/92-93) with weak attributions. As regard the differences
about his age at the time he embraced Islam, see As-Sunan Al-Kubra by
Bayhaqi (6/206-207).
274Reported by Ibn Hishdm (1/315-316) in a Suspended (Mu’allaq) form, and
Tirmidhi with a slight change in the text of the Hadith. See: SahihutTirmidhi by Albani (3/231/H. 4085). Jabalah (brother of Zayd) is reported
in it that it was he who went to the Prophet gjg seeking the release of his
brother Zayd. Tirmidhi said, "This Hadith is Good & Unfamiliar (HasanGharib)” Albani also said it is Hasan. Hakim reported it in Al-Mustadrak
(3/214), adding: "Its chain is Sahih although the two (Bukhari and
Muslim) did not trace it." Dhahabi also said that it is Sahih. Tabarani
reported it in Al-Mu'jam Al-Kabir (2/321-322). Haythami said in Al-Majma'
(<9/274), "Its chain is of Hasan grade." Also see it traced in the footnotes of
the two verifiers of Sirat Ibn Hishdm (1/316). This is a popularly known
report. One might look for it in the books of Sirat, e.g. 'Uyunul-Athar (1/
94), Ibn Ishaq — Ibn Hishdm (1/314), and Siratudh-Dhahabi, pp. 137-138.
275 Surat Al-Ahzab: 5. The narration is in Sahih in the Sahih Sunanut-Tirmidhi
by Albani (3/231) being a Hadith of Ibn 'Umar. Tirmidhi and Albani said
it is Sahih.

Abu Bakr Siddiq

161

He was the first of men to accept the call

of Islam. The Prophet

once told 'Umar about him, "Allah

commissioned me to you. You all said, 'You are lying.' But
Abu Bakr said, 'You spoke the truth.'"276 He also said, "I did
not invite anyone to Islam but he seemed to be undecided,
shaky and with second thought, except for Abu Bakr. When I
spoke to him, he evinced no hesitation and no undecidedness
at all."277 Abu Bakr himself spoke of himself when he was
chosen for caliphate: "Am I not the most deserving of (this
honor) than anyone else of you? Am I not the first to have
believed?"278
Remaining within the framework of secrecy, Abu Bakr actively
engaged himself in inviting his relatives, friends and acquaintances
to Islam. Souls that were noble responded positively such as,
'Uthman bin 'Affan, Zubayr bin 'Awwam, Talhah bin 'Ubaydullah,
Sa'd bin Abu Waqqas, 'Abdur-Rahman bin 'Awf,279 'Uthman bin
Maz'un, Abu 'Ubaydah bin Jarrah, Abu Salamah bin 'Abdul-Asad
and Arqam bin Abu Arqam.
276 A Hadith reported in Al-Bukhdri/Al-Fath (14/157/H. 3661). Ibn Kathir said
in Al-Bidayah (3/30): "This is a textual report that he is the first to embrace
Islam."
277 Reported by Ibn Ishaq in As-Siyar wal-Maghdzi, p. 139, with an Interrupted
(Munqari') chain, thus it is weak as we know.
278 A Hadith recorded by Tirmidhi. See: Sahihut-Tirmidhi (3/201) both
Tirmidhi and Albani judged it as Sahih. There were many Sahih Ahadith
that emphasize that Abu Bakr ^ was the first to embrace Islam among
men. See Al-Bidayah wan-Nihdyah (3/30-32). Ibn Kathir discussed there the
reports that contradict this fact. See also 'Uyunul-Athar (1/94-95), Ibn
Hisham (1/316-319), Sirat Ibn Ishaq, pp. 139-40, Sirat Adh-Dhahabi, p. 138,
Fadd'ilus-Sahabah by Ibn Hanbal (1/223-231) under the title: What has been
reported on Abu Bakr as the first one to embrace Islam.
Ibn Mas'ud said: "The first to declare Islam were seven: The Messenger of
Allah, Abu Bakr..." Its chain is Sahih and the report will be mentioned in
detail when discussing the torture of the slaves.
279 Up to here Ibn Ishaq mentioned them in his Sirat, p. 140, and in Sirat Ibn
Hisham (1/317-318) without a chain.
280 And from Ibn Maz'un to Arqam, it was Ibn Kathir who stated their names
in Al-Bidayah wan-Nihdyah (3/33) to the effect that they embraced Islam
through Abu Bakr: an addition in report over those of others.

The Prophet of Islam

162

Because of Abu Bakr's contacts, Islam began to spread quietly
but firmly in Makkah281 and outside it. Many Qurayshis also
embraced Islam. The following non-Qurayshis also embraced Islam
because of Abu Bakr's influence: Bilal bin Rabah, Suhayb bin Smart,
'Ammar bin Yasir, his father Yasir and mother Sumaiyah bint
Khayyat.282
Within a short time the number of those who embraced Islam
from among the Quraysh rose up to forty. That's Ibn Hisham's-83
figure. If we go by that of Ya'mari,284 it was fifty.
(v) Waraqah bin Nawfal. He is also counted among those who
embraced Islam. This is supported by the Prophet's words: "When I
saw him (during the Mi'raj journey), he was in white attire. If he was
of the people of Fire, he wouldn't be in white clothes."2S:1 According
to another report, "I saw him in the center of Paradise clad in white
attire.286 He had silken clothes on him." He also said, "Don't speak

281 In the report concerning the Islam of 'Amr bin 'Abasah in Sahih Muslim¬
as mentioned earlier —is a proof of the extension of Islam outside Makkah.
In the said report the Prophet |jg said to him: "...Catch up with your
people, and if you are told that I have left (Makkah), then follow me."
282 Their mention has been made in a Discontinued (Mauquf) Hadith by
Mujahid and its chain is Sahih, see it in Fada'ilus-Sahabah by Ibn Hanbal
(1/231). It was reported by Ibn Sa'd through Mujahid (3/233), and Ibn
Hanbal in Fada'ilus-Sahabah (1/181) by Ibn Mas'ud with Good &
Connected (Hasan-Muttasil) chain. It was also reported by the verifier. See
the Musnad (1/404), Bayhaqi in the Dala'il (2/170) and Hakim in the
Mustadrak (3/84) who said there, "Of a Sahih chain that the two did not
trace." Dhahabi agreed with him. See as well as Ibn Hishdm (1/324) and
Ibn Sa'd (3/226). Tabarani reported it in Al-Mu'jam Al-Kabir (8/34) through
Anas (8/131) as well as by Abu Umamah. Haythami said in the Majma'
(9/305), "Its narrators are reliable except for 'Umarah bin Zadhan who too
was trustworthy. However there is difference in opinion over him and so
its chain is Hasan.

ill of Waraqah. I saw that he had for himself one or two sections of
Paradise."28" On another occasion he said, "He will be raised as a
nation by himself."288
If we are to look carefully at the names of those who embraced
Islam right at its start, we find that they were the best men of their
people. They were not, as some Muslim and non-Muslim writers
have said, the lowest of the low, the slaves or others who were
looking for a relief from oppression.
Their names came to be remembered better because, firstly, it
was only the weakest of Muslims (such as the slaves), who bore
the brunt of persecution in the early days of Islam. Secondly, they
were persecuted in the open. So, everyone knew about them. In
contrast,

others

escaped

tortures by

dint of tribal contacts.

Moreover, whoever of the free men received persecution, received
it from his own tribesmen and so, their persecution did not receive
publicity.289
We have several reports that confirm this. One in Ahmad290 has
Ibn Mas'ud saying, "The first of those who declared their Islam
were seven: The Prophet, Abu Bakr, 'Ammar, his mother Sumaiyah,
Suhayb, Bilal and Miqdad.291 As for the Prophet m,, he was rescued
by his uncle. Abu Bakr *>, escaped on account of his tribe. But for
the rest, the pagans clad them in steel and made them stand in the
sun."

287 Reported by Bazzar through 'Aishah A, as mentioned by Ibn Kathir in AlBidayah wan-Nihayah (10/3). The latter said about its chain to be Perfect
('Jaiyid). Hakim reported it in Al-Mustadrak (2/409) as a narration of
'Aishah A and said that the Hadith is Sahih. Dhahabi agreed with it. The
Hadith is therefore, Hasan because of these several chains. See also Albani
in the footnotes of Fiqhus-Sirah by Ghazali, p. 100.
288 Reported by Tabarani in the Majma' (9/416) about which Haythami said:
"Its transmitters are narrators of Sahih Hadith.”
289 See Shami: Min Ma'inis-Sirah, pp. 35-36.
290 This has been mentioned before where we stated that Wasiullah
considered the Hadith as Hasan — Fadd ilus-Sahdbah (1/182).
291 Ibn Sa'd (3/233) a Disconnected (Mursal) Hadith by Mujahid, he mentioned
Khabbab instead of Miqdad in the Hadith reported by Ahmad.

The Prophet of Islam

164

Ibn Ishaq292 reports that the Quraysh took to persecuting those
who had embraced Islam and every tribe fell upon those of its
members who had embraced Islam, torturing and persecuting
them.293 He also mentions that members of the Banu Makhzum tribe
went up to Hisham bin Walid when his brother Walid became a
Muslim. They asked him his permission to do whatever was
necessary to bring him back and those others of the Banu Makhzum
that had embraced Islam, to the old religion. Salamah bin Hisham
and 'Ayyash bin Abu Rabi'ah were some of those who had become
Muslims. Hisham allowed them to use whatever means they saw fit
without going to the extent of killing them.
Ibn Ishaq294 also narrates the story of 'Umar bin Khattab's
Hz/ra/i-journey. He was accompanied by 'Ayyash. The Quraysh
prevented a third person, Hisham bin 'Asi bin Wa'il Sahini from
accompanying the two and then, later brought back 'Ayyash by
trickery, bound in chains.
Before he himself became a Muslim, 'Umar bin Khattab used to
torment Sa'eed bin Zayd, a cousin of his in his effort to revert him to
pagandom.295
The Prophet #§ was unable to do anything to prevent the
persecution. In fact, even after he was in Madinah, he could do no
more than resort to supplications for those who were left at Makkah.
He used to supplicate, "O Allah, rescue Walid bin Walid, Salamah
bin Hisham, 'Ayyash bin Abu Rabi'ah and the other weak ones in
Makkah. O Allah, tighten Your grip on the Mudar (tribe) sending
them starvation like the starvation of the times of Yusuf.''296
292 As-Sirat 148, and Ibn Hisham from a narration of Ibn Ishaq without a chain
(1/392) hence it is very weak.
293 Ibn Hisham (1/396) from a narration of Ibn Ishaq with an Interrupted
(Munqati') chain.
294 Sirat Ibn Hisham (1/129) reported by Ibn Ishaq through a Hasan chain.
Reported by Bazzar, through trustworthy narrators as mentioned by
Haythami in the Majma' (6/62), Bayhaqi in Ad-Dalail (2/461-462) and AsSanan Al-Kubra (9/13-14) through Ibn Ishaq.
295 Al-Bukhari/Al-Fath (15/19/H. 3862).

Ibn Sa'd (4/1/96) has the same chain Muslim reported it (1/467, H. 675) as
well as Bukhari through different chains including (2/242) and (8/170).

165

Ibn Hajar297 has explained the words "the weak ones" and the
"honored ones" that were used during the conversation between
Heraclius and Abu Sufyan in the following manner. He explained the
former ("the weak ones") as meaning the Prophet's early followers.
They were so called because they were humble people (Du'afa') as
against the arrogant ones (Aqwiya') who stood against the call of truth
out of hatred and jealousy. Thus, and in contrast, the term "honored
ones" was used in the sense of those who acted arrogantly.
It might also be noted that out of the first 67 that embraced
Islam in the beginning, only 13 belonged to the category of the poor,
the slaves, and those who did not have tribal support because they
were foreigners in the land. In other words they were just about onefifth of the total. Therefore, it is perhaps not right to say that the
great majority of the early Muslims, the so-called weak ones, were of
the lower strata of the society.298
Lessons
1.

Allah's injunction to the Prophet 0 to observe secrecy in the
beginning was to impress on all future callers that whatever
means that can be adopted for the call, might be adopted. The
caller should use his own mind and experience to adopt the
means that will help him achieve his objectives, except that for
the outcome and consequences, total trust may not be placed in
those means alone — in place of trust in Allah. The caller s
wholehearted reliance on them can weaken his faith in his Lord.
We can also deduce from the above that the strategy that the
Prophet 0 adopted in this stage was not following a religious
directive received from above. In choosing to do what he did,
he did not act in the capacity of a Prophet. He simply acted in
the capacity of one who is at the helm of affairs.“

The scholars are unanimous that when Muslims are weak, or
few in number and are convinced that if they stood up against
the disbelieving tyrants, they would be annihilated, then it is
allowed that they act in prudence and save their souls from
destruction. For, in the face of a destruction that is certain, it
might only be assumptive that they will succeed and establish
Islam. In such a situation, what is certain is to be followed in
contrast to what is only assumptive. Tzz bin 'Abdus-Salanr 00
has declared this a practical principle. Dr. Buti301 has in his
comments said that from the point of view of practicality and
long-term strategy this is the right course of action. In truth,
such an action would be better for the cause of religion.
Religious requirement in such situations is that Muslim souls
should be saved from destruction so that they may continue
with their struggle in fields of action open to them. Otherwise,
their destruction would be injurious to the cause of Islam and
will allow the disbelievers to penetrate through those doors that
were earlier closed to them.
The principle derived from the above is clear: Preference should
be given to what is of sure advantage to religion over what
could expectedly be so, but not certain.

The Second Phase: Open Call
Ahmad302 has reported on the authority of 'Ali 4* who said,
"When the Verse, 'Warn your close kin’ was revealed, the Prophet ^
got his family members gathered together. They numbered close to
thirty. They were offered food and drinks. After that he spoke to
them and ended by asking: 'Who will help me in my religion and

my covenant, so as to be with me in Paradise and my successor in
the family?' One of them said, 'O Messenger of Allah. You are
endowed with extraordinary qualities. Who can match up with
you?' So, he put forth the question to those who were more closely
related to him. 'Ali said, 'I will.'"
Ibn Ishaq's303 version says that the Prophet j|§ told them in that
meeting, "O sons of 'Abdul-Muttalib. By Allah, I do not know of
another man who brought anything better than what I have
brought. I have brought something that is good for this world, as
well as for the next."
Subsequently the Prophet ^ drew other plans to execute
Allah's commands. Bukhari304 and Muslim305 report Ibn 'Abbas as
saying, "When the Verse:

'Warn your close kin306
and the direction, 'and the sincere ones of your clan,'307came down, the
Prophet m went out and climbed Mount Safa. He called out.

303 As-Siyar wal-Maghazi, pp. 145-146. Tabari connected its chain in his Tafsir
(19/75). However, both the narrations are weak, but gather strength from
other reports. And another of the supportive Hadith is reported by Ahmad,
already mentioned through two chains. Yet another narration is by Ibn
Abu Hatim who traces it to 'Ali 4= which is the version that Ibn Kathir
quoted in his Tafsir (6/180-181).
304 Al-Fath (18/397/H. 4971-4972). The words here are his.
305 Muslim (1/194/H. 208).
306 Surat Ash-Shu'ara': 214.
307 Nawawi said: "It seemed this was a Qur'anic passage that was revealed
but subsequently whose recitation was abrogated. However, this addition
did not occur in Bukhari's reports. See its explanation in Sahih Muslim (3/
82-83). This was mentioned by Muhammad Fuwad 'Abdul-Baqi in his
commentary on Sahih Muslim (1/194), but he passed no remark on it. And
Dr Qala'ji while commenting on Dalail of Bayhaqi (2/181) also made no
comments. Ibn Hajar (.Al-Fath 18/113) reminded us of its presence in AlBukhari's narration by Ibn 'Abbas as is clear from the Hadith that was
recorded there. This addition is not found in Bukhari in the Book of Tafsir,
Surat Ash-Shur'ara', chapter: "And warn your tribe of near kindred," Al-Fath

'Hearken to me.' They enquired, 'Who is this?' and began to
assemble. He asked them, 'Will you believe me if I said that riders
are about to appear from the foot of this mountain. Will you believe
me?' They answered, 'We have not experienced a lie from you.' He
said, 'Then, let me tell you that I am a warner unto you about a
looming chastisement.' Abu Lahab replied, 'May you be destroyed.
Did you assemble us for this?' And Allah (3g) revealed.

onn

"Destroyed be the hands of Abu Lahab; and destroyed be he."'
The Sahihayn309 have also preserved a report transmitted by
Abu Hurayrah 4® that when the Verse 'Warn your close kin,' was
revealed, the Prophet ^ invited everyone of the Quraysh to his
house. He addressed them in words, 'O sons of Ka'b bin Lu'ay, save
yourselves from the Fire. O sons of Murrah bin Ka'b, save
yourselves from the Fire. O sons of 'Abd Shams, save yourselves
from the Fire. O sons of 'Abd Manaf, save yourselves from the Fire.
O sons of Hashim, O sons of 'Abdul-Muttalib, O Fatimah I can do
nothing for you on the Day you will face Allah —except for the
rights (of kin in this world), which I shall observe to the best of my
ability/'
This loud call was performed with utmost eloquence. He called
them by their tribal and family names and then invited them
individually. He made it clear to the closely related kin that his call
would revive and strengthen the blood relationship. But, he asserted
that relationship on the basis of tribes and families would dissolve in
the heat of the call coming from Allah.310

(18/113/H. 4770). See the explanation of Ibn Hajar to this addition. This
Hadith has been narrated through different chains, in different words,
nevertheless the meaning was the same. See it, for example, in SiratudhDhahabi, pp. 143-144, Dald'il by Bayhaqi (2/181-182) and Al-Biddyah wanNihdyah (3/42-44).

Lessons

1.

The negative attitude of the Prophet's dose kin in this phase,
especially of the Qurayshites, rejects the hypotheses that this
religion was the result of rising nationalism or tribalism among
the Arabs and that Muhammad's call was in direct response to
such desires.

2.

People's slow entry into Islam is a reminder of the powerful
hold of the traditions and legacies of the pagan societies on
individuals. The caller encounters this in every society, old and
new, in fact, even in Muslim societies. Whenever a call is made
for the use of reason and logic that is guided by the Sunnah of
the Prophet ^ and of the pious predecessors in understanding
Islam, it is the traditions and legacies of the past that stand up
against it as barriers to acceptance.

3.

The specific instruction to warn, signals to every Muslim, and
especially the callers, their responsibility toward their religion.
The Prophet ^ was responsible for himself and bore the
responsibility for his kinsfolk, being related to them. Then he
assumed the responsibility for all mankind, in that he was a
Prophet and Messenger unto all mankind.
Even so, everyone of the Muslim society shares the same
responsibility with the Prophet: as an individual unto himself
and toward his relatives if he has a family. Scholars and rulers
bear the third responsibility towards the people.

Pagan Methods of Resistance to the Call
The echoes of the call —u?am your close kin-had not yet died
down entirely in the valleys of Makkah when Allah (M) revealed:

311 Dr. Buti: Fiqhus-Sirah, pp. 81-82.

170

The Prophet of Islam

"Therefore, proclaim what you are being commanded and shun

the pagans."312
The Prophet j|| rose up with all vigor, proclaiming the truth,
forbidding the worship of stones, deriding those who believed in
them, demonstrating the truth of Islam and refuting the false beliefs
that enjoyed a hold on the pre-Islamic minds.
When the Quraysh noticed that the effect of this call was not
limited to a few individuals, as had been the case earlier when
similar calls to abandon the idols were raised by others, such as
Zayd bin Nufayl, Waraqah and Ibn Sayfi, they stood up against the
Prophet

and those who had believed in him. They tried various

'stick and carrot' methods to prevent the spread of a message that
seemed to threaten their interests. The very existence of the Ka'bah
between them assured them of certain privileges which they feared
would be lost. The call also hurt their pride and stood between their
good sense and their carnal desires. Accordingly, the most
vehement in opposition were either the most corrupt or those
whose interests were most affected.

(i) Measures taken by the Quraysh to prevent the Spread of
the Message
The first action the Quraysh took was to meet the Prophet's
uncle Abu Talib to ask him to restrain his nephew or renounce
him. They went in the form of a delegation. They said, "Your
nephew has insulted our deities, found fault with our religion,
made

fun

of

our

endeavors

and

criticized

our

forefathers.

Therefore, either you stop him from all this, or remove yourself
from between him and us. For, as we see, you face the same
dilemma as we. Nevertheless, we shall take care of him." Abu
Talib spoke some comforting words answering them in good
grace. So they left him.313

312 Surat Al-Hijr: 94.
3' * 3 ibn Hisham (1/328) from the narration of Ibn Ishaq without a chain.

(ii) Threatening the Prophet $§; and His Uncle

When the Prophet
continued with his call, in his effort to give
this religion an upper hand over all others, the Quraysh lost their
composure. They declared him an enemy of theirs, and he became a
much discussed person. Finally, they convinced each other to go
and see Abu Talib once again. They said to him, "O Abu Talib. You
enjoy the advantage of age and honor over us. We asked you to
restrain your nephew, but you haven't." Then they swore before
him that they would never sit back until they had either stopped his
activities, or will perforce clash with him and with Muhammad over
the issue until one of them is defeated.
It was rather hard for Abu Talib to lose his tribesmen and earn
their enmity. But at the same time, he did not find fault with the
Prophet m, or his mission. Therefore, although after they had left he
informed the Prophet $yg of what had transpired between him and
his tribesmen, he also told the Prophet
that he was free to act the
way he felt pleased.314 But Abu Talib pleaded that he should not
burden him with more than what he could bear.
Ibn Ishaq's316 version is that the Prophet m, felt a weakening on
the part of his uncle and so told him, "Uncle. By Allah. If they place
the sun in my right hand, and the moon on the left asking me to give
up, I shall not do it until either Allah gives it victory or I die in its
cause." Then, overcome by his emotions, he cried and rose up to go.
His uncle said, "Come back my nephew." When he went back he
said, "Go ahead (with your works) my dear nephew. I only said that
out of love. Otherwise, I shall not abandon you in return of anything
in the world." Another report, also in Ibn Ishaq,317 has Aqil as the

314 Same source and place as well as in Sirat of Ibn Ishaq, p. U5. And Ibn
Ishaq's narration at both points is Suspended (Mu allaq) and hence the
report is weak.

beginning. The narrators of Abu Ya'la are authentic. Albam mentioned in

narrator. It was he who was asked to summon the Prophet j*. When
the Prophet went up sgg to his uncle, he said, "Your tribesmen
(sitting here) complain that you condemn their deities in every
assembly. You better stop doing that." At that, the Prophet
looked up into the sky and said, "Do you see the sun?" They
replied, "Yes." He said, "I am no more capable of giving up this
mission than you are capable of stealing a flame from the sun." Abu
Talib replied, "By God, we do not suspect our nephew of lies. So,
return, all of you." This report is the one that is Sound (Sahih).

Lessons

The above of course speaks a lot about the firmness and courage
of the Prophet
But his uncle Abu Talib's stand was, to say the
least, amazing. Ibn Kathir318 too was unable to explain it save for
saying, "Allah filled his heart with Muhammad's love. That was
natural love, and not the love that is in, or for Allah. On the other
hand, there was some advantage in his continuance on his old
religion, and his defence of the Prophet
If Abu Talib had
embraced Islam, he would have lost his standing among the
Quraysh, who would have felt emboldened. They would have been
sure to extend their evil tongues and hands toward him: 'And your
Lord creates what He wills and chooses (whom He wills).' He has thus
created His creations on different patterns. Here we have two
uncles: Abu Talib and Abu Lahab. One of them (Abu Talib) will be
in the Fire up to his ankles."' The other will be in the bottommost
pit of the Fire. In reference to the latter Allah (^) sent down Verses

Haythami's Hadith: "That this story was reported in brief by Tabari in his
book Al-Awsat and Al-Kabir being a Hadith of 'Aqil bin Abu Talib Dhahabi
also reported it in the Sirat, pp. 148-149, with the same chain as of Ibn
Ishaq." Then he added: "Reported by Bukhari in the Tdrikh as reported bv
Abu Kurayb, and he from Yunus." And in Dald’il of Bayhaqi (2/186) being
a report of 'Aqil. Bayhaqi said: "Reported bv Bukhari in the Tdrikh
through Muhammad bin 'Ala, he through Yunus (4/1/51)."

admonitory sermons. It proclaims that he will be in the flames with
his wife carrying fuel."320
So long as Abu Talib was alive, he continued to shield the
Prophet £3 against his adversaries. But he himself stayed away from
Islam. It is said that the Verse,

"And they prevent others from him and stay away from him,"3n

was revealed in reference to him.

209j. And the light punishment was because of the Prophet £gg. The word
Dahdah in the original Arabic is for a thin stream of water that just reaches
the ankle.
320 It has been previously mentioned that Surat Al-Masad was revealed in
connection with Abu Lahab, as has been reported by the Shaykhayn, and
others.

321 Surat Al-An'am: 26.
322 Ibn Jawzi said in Zadul-Masir (3/27) that there are two reasons for the
revelation of this Verse: One, Abu Talib used to prevent the polytheists
from harming the Prophet jg although he kept himself away from this new
religion. Ibn Jawzi added: "Narrated by Sa'eed bin Jubayr through Ibn
'Abbas. And this is the opinion of 'Amr bin Dinar, 'Ata bin Dinar an
Qasim bin Mukhaymarah" The other reason was that the infidels of
Makkah used to prevept people from following the Prophet
while
distancing themselves also from him. To this lie added^ Peported y
Walibi through Ibn 'Abbas, as well as Ibn Hanafiyyah, Dahhak and Suddi.
I may point out that Ibn Ishaq too reported this in his Sirat, p. 238, with a
chain of his own ending with Ibn 'Abbas, but kept the name of one of the
transmitters obscure. See also Tafsir At-Tabari with the verification of
Shakir (11/311-315) in the explanation of this Verse.

174

The Prophet of Islam

revealed the following Verse describing their allegation:

"They said, 'O you to whom the admonition has been revealed,
surely, you are mad.'"323
In answer to the allegation He revealed:

"You, by the grace of your Lord, are not mad."324
b) They accused him of magic. Allah (M) said:

"It surprises them that a warner has been raised from among
them, and so the didbelievers said, 'This is a magician, liar.'"325
And:

"And the transgressors said, 'Surely, you follow not but a man
under the spell of magic.'"326
Walid bin Mughirah was at his wit's end to counter the effects
of the Qur'anic revelations. When Hajj season came close he
gathered together the Quraysh chieftains and told them, "O
Quraysh. Hajj season is upon us. Soon the Arab pilgrims will start
coming in. They must have already heard of this man (i.e.,
Muhammad). You had better close your ranks and be of one

devil against Musa in more than one chapter in the holy Qur'an. See for
example: Surat Al-Qasas: 36 and Surat An-Naml: 13. The accusations were
also repeated by tyrants against most Messengers of Allah. See: Surat AdhDhariyydt: 52.

opinion about him. Do not differ among yourselves, otherwise,
some of you will end up contradicting others." When the ideas of
calling him a soothsayer, a poet, or a magician were declared
inadequate, they decided that they will call him "a magician" who
creates divisions among the closely-related. Allah revealed in
reference to Walid:

"Leave Me (to deal with) him whom I alone have created."327
Then the Quraysh went about informing the people about
Muhammad. Allah willed that it should be the Quraysh themselves
to carry His message far and wide through the pilgrims. And that is
what happened.
This manner of response from the Quraysh actually became the
reason for some peopled entry into Islam. Tufayl bin 'Amr Dawsi is

c) They also accused him of lying. Allah revealed:

describe Walid.

Tabari also reported it in his Tafsir (14/157) through Ibn Ishaq, the
narration stopping at Ibn 'Abbas
while he insisted at hearing it off
him. However, it is narrated by Abu Nu aym in Ad-Dala il (1/232) in a
manner that it is Mur sal at the beginning of the report but continuous at
the end of it. The two verifiers of Sirat Ibn Hishdm (1/336) said: “It has
been reported by 'Abd bin Humayd, Ibn Mundhir and Ibn Abu Hatim in
brief. See Ad-Durr Al-Manthur (6/282). Wahidy reported it briefly while
discussing the causes of the revelation through Ibn Ishaq, p. 295. However,
that chain has Ibrahim bin Ishaq Dabari whose authenticity has been
questioned. See also Al-Mizan (1/181).
329See it in Daid'd of Abu Nu'aym (1/238-240). The two verifiers said:
"Bayhaqi reported it through Ibn Ishaq with a Suspended (Mu'allaq) chain.
It is in the Sirat too, (1/238) although without a chain. He said in AlKhasais (1/337): “Recorded by Abu Nu'aym through Waqidi...Ibn Ishaq
however, produced the complete chain in some of the editions tracing it
through Salih bin Kaysan, he through Tufayl bin 'Amr, although it is in all
other editions without a chain...

^^
"And, that is how We have tried some of them with the others so
that they may say, 'Are these the ones from amongst us that

Bukhari335 has a report that when the revelation stopped for a

since two or three days." Allah revealed:

regarding the cause of revelation of these Verses, some of which are
acceptable, while others are rejected. See Ibn Hajar: Al-Fath (18/336-364.)
336Al-Fath (17/185/H. 4648).

The Prophet of Islam

178

"And when they said, '0 Allah! If this be the truth from You,
then rain down on us stones from the heaven or send us a painful
chastisement.' But Allah is not such as to punish them while you
are among them. And Allah is not such as to punish them while
they are seeking forgiveness. But why should Allah not punish
them when they prevent (the people) from the Holy House?"'37
Ibn Ishaq338 has the story of Irashi from whom Abu Jahl
purchased a camel but delayed payment of its price. Quraysh
directed Irashi to appeal to Muhammad #|, well aware of the
enmity between Abu Jahl and him. When Irashi went up to the
Prophet !§;, he accompanied him up to Abu Jahl to ask him to pay
up. Abu Jahl quietly paid the amount. When the surprised Quraysh
asked Abu Jahl to explain, he said, "Woe unto you men. When he
knocked at my door and I recognized his voice, I was filled with
terror. When I came out I found him accompanied by a huge camel
with a high hump, a massive body, and teeth never seen before. By
God, I thought it would eat me off."
Allah (S) said about their mockery and derision:

"Surely those who committed crimes used to laugh at the
believers. When they passed by them they winked at one another.
And when they turned to their home folk, they turned
wallowing."339

337 Surat Al-Anfal: 32-34.
338 As-Siyar wal-Maghazi, pp. 195-196, with a broken chain, and Ibn Hisham
(2/33-34) quoting the chain of Ibn Ishaq in the Sirat and so is weak.
339 Surat Al-Mutaffifin: 29-31.

From Birth to Emigration

179

It is also authentically reported that once the Quraysh chieftains
were in an assembly in the Holy House speaking about the Prophet
when he himself happened to drop in. When he passed by them,
they uttered a few indirect words of mockery. When they repeated it
three times, the Prophet

told them, "O Quraysh. By Him in

Whose Hand is my life, I have brought you slaughter/' Those words
drove terror into their hearts.340
It was out of mockery and derision that the pagans told the
Prophet |j|, "We cannot accept the company of these (meaning Bilal,
Suhayb, Khabbab and others). Send them away from you." In hope
of their Islam, the Prophet

thought he would comply with their

demand. But Allah revealed the Verse:

"Do not drive away those who call their Lord morning and
evening seeking His Face. Their accountability is not on you, nor
yours on them. If you drive them away, you will be of the
transgressors."341
On another occasion the Prophet

happened to pass by a

group of Qurayshi men. They derided him, mocked him and
angered him. So Allah (#g) revealed:

34(1 Recorded by Ahmad in the Musnad as in ATFathur-Rabbani (20/219-220) —
Ahmad Shakir's edition (11/227/H. 7036.) Shakir said its chain is Sahih. So
said Ibn Abu Shaybah in the Musannaf (14/297). Ibn Ishaq also reported
through a Hasan chain—Ibn Hishdm (1/358).
341 Surat Al-An'am: 52. See the reason for revelation in Tafsir At-Tabari (11/
374-388). Tabari has gathered together all the reports in this connection.
Shaykh Shakir traced them and verified them. The meaning we have given
in the text herewith is a summary of the narration numbered (13258)
coming through a Sahih chain. Muslim and Nasa i reported part of the
Hadith coming off Sa'd bin Abu Waqqas. (See also the Tafsir of this Verse
in Ibn Kathir, Qurtubi and others.)

"Surely, Messengers were mocked before you. Consequently,
those who had mocked were overtaken by the very thing they were
mocking (i.e., the punishment)."342
The following were the leading mockers: Aswad bin 'AbdulMuttalib bin Asad,343 Aswad bin 'Abd Yaghuth bin Wahb Zuhri,
Walid bin Mughirah Makhzumi, 'As bin Wa'il bin Sahmi344 and
Harith bin Talatilah Khuza'i.345 It is about these that Allah

Accordingly, it is reported by Abu Nu'aym 7

that Jibril

However, the commentators did not mention any specific reason for the
revelation of this Verse. And whoever mentioned a reason, he narrated it
through Ibn Ishaq, for e.g., Ibn Mundhir and Ibn Abu Hatim as in AdDurr Al-Manthur (3/5).
343 This was stated by Ibn Hajar in Al-Fath (18/359) and Abu Nu'aym in AdDalail (1/268). See Ibn Hisham (2/57) and the report of Abu Nu'aym from
the Hadith of Ibn Ishaq through a Hasan chain; but it is a Disconnected

345 These five were mentioned by Abu Nu'aym in Ad-Dald'il (1/268), relying
on a report of Ibn Ishaq through a Hasan chain but it is a Mursal one, and
through another chain (1/270/H. 203) with the chain ending at Ibn
'Abbas. Nonetheless, one of the narrators is Kalbi who had been
abandoned as a narrator.
M<'Dala'il An-Nubuwwah (1/268) from a narration of Ibn Ishaq through a
Hasan chain, but it is Mursal. It is one of the narrations of Ibrahim bin Sa'd
who was one of the students of Ibn Ishaq.

Interrupted (Munqati') chain — Ibn Hisham (2/33-34), with the chain of Ibn
Ishaq in As-Siyar wal-Maghazi.

he became blind. He (Jibril) pointed at Aswad bin 'Abd Yaghuth's
stomach. He died of a stomach ailment. As he passed by Walid
bin Mughirah, he pointed at a wound he had received some years
ago, below his ankle. It grew worse and he died of it. He passed
by 'As bin Wa'il and pointed at the hollow of his sole. When the
man went to Ta'if on his donkey a thorn pierced the hollow of
his sole. He died because of it. Jibril passed by Harith bin
Talatilah and pointed at his head. The man began to vomit and
ultimately died.348
Some others who were also in the forefront of those who
mocked were: Abu Jahl, Umaiyah bin Khalaf, Nadr bin Harith,
Akhnas bin Shurayq and Ubaiy bin Khalaf.349

(v) Disturbances
The pagans had made an agreement between themselves that
they would make noise and create disturbances whenever the
Qur'an was recited in their presence, so that it was not heard.

348 Reported by Abu Nu'aym in Ad-Dala'il (1/268-269). The two verifiers said:
"Reported by Ibn Ishaq in the Sirat (2/58-59), and his narrators are
trustworthy. Ibn Ishaq insisted on having heard (it), yet it is Disconnected
(Mursal) report." Suyuti said in Al-Khasais (1/365): "Recorded by Bayhaqi
and Abu Nu'aym through Ibn 'Abbas." Then he mentioned a report close
to one under discussion and added, "Haythami mentioned in Majma'uzZawa'id (7/47) after reporting through Ibn 'Abbas as to what caused the
revelation of We will suffice you against the mockers,' in meaning similar to
the meaning of the Hadith of the chapter. This was recorded by Tabarani
in Al-Awsat, whose narrators include Muhammad bin 'Abdul-Hakim
Nishapuri, with whom I am unfamiliar. However, the rest of the narrators
are trustworthy." Ibn Hajar in Al-Fath (18/3) described how 'As was
destroyed.
Dhahabi has a Sahih report in his Sirat (pp. 224-225) that comes from Ibn
'Abbas
discussing the destruction of these mockers. It follows a route
different from that of Ibn Ishaq. Bayhaqi's report is in Sunan (8/9) through
trustworthy transmitters except 'Umar bin 'Abdullah bin Razin, who was
in any case reliable. In short, the report can be used for scholarly
purposes.

for miracles and supernatural feats. Allah reported to us their
words:

And:

been sent doum to him?' Had We sent down an angel, the matter would have
been settled at once, and no respite zoould be granted to them." Surat Al-An'am:

"And they said, 'We shall never believe in you until you opened
forth from the earth a spring. Or, you have an orchard of date
palm and grapes and make springs run through them. Or, you
send down upon us pieces of heaven as you allege, or bring forth

house made of gold, or climb up into the heaven. Nevertheless, we
shall never believe in you until you bring down a book that we
can read.'"
The Prophet |j§ was told to answer them, as in the same Verse:

"Say, 'Glory to my Lord. Am I anything more but a human being
and a Messenger.'"353
They also demanded that he move the Makkan mountains, split
the earth and produce canals so that they could cultivate the land.
He was also asked to bring back to life their ancestors so that they
could ask them if he was an authentic Prophet. Allah (ii) answered

all affairs are Allah's." (i.e., I have no powers, it is only Allah
Who has that kind of power).354
Obviously, their demands were out of arrogance, not out of a
sincere desire to believe. Therefore, those miracles were not shown.
Allah said to them:

"And they swore by Allah emphatically that if a sign came to
them they'd believe. Say, 'Verily, signs are with Allah.' And
what will tell you that if they were shown, they would not
believe... And, if We were to send down angels to them, the dead
spoke to them, and We gathered everything right before them,
they would still not believe, unless Allah were to will so. But
most of them understand not."355
Allah also said:

354 Surat Ar-Ra'd: 31. See also Ibn Kathir (4/382) for the cause of revelation, as
well as Tafsir of Tabari (16/446-450/Shakir) where the report has a
continuous chain up to Ibn 'Abbas as also in a Mursal form leading up to
Mujahid and Dahhak. Ibn Ishaq also recorded but without a chain— Ibn
Hisham (1/381). See Shami: Subulul-Huda (2/456-457) through a Hadith
reported by Abu Ya'la and Abu Nu'aym through Zubayr bin Awwam.
Look for it in (2/452) in regard to this Hadith as narrations of Ibn Ishaq,
Ibn Jarir and Bayhaqi.

"And nothing prevented Us from sending signs except that the

Ahmad3-1' has preserved a Hadith of Ibn 'Abbas 4 which says,
"The Makkans demanded that the Prophet

convert Mount Safa

into that of gold and shift the mountains in close range far away so
that they could irrigate the land. It was said to him that if he wished
he could give them respite/ but, if he wished those signs could be
sent down on condition that if they didn't believe they would be
destroyed like the previous nations. The Prophet #| chose to wait.

356 Surat Al-Isra59. See Ibn Kathir: Al-Bidayah wan-Nihayah (3/55).
357See Al-Fathur-Rabbani (20/222-223) narrated through two chains, both
copied by Ibn Kathir in Al-Biddyah wan-Nihayah (3/57) where he said:
“These are two narratives with good chains. It has also came as a Mursal
report from a group of the Followers, such as: Sa'eed bin Jubayr, Qatadah,
and Ibn Jurayj and others." He added: "This is how Nasa'i recorded it
from Jarir." Sa'ati -said in Al-Fathur-Rabbdni (20/223): "Reported by
Haythami," and then added: "The narrators of the two reports are
trustworthy except for the fact that one of the chains has Imran bin
Hakam (meaning the report concerning this chapter), but that is an error.
In some of the chains occurs Imran Abul-Hakam who was the son of
Harith, and which is correct. Bazzar also narrated it in the like manner."
Sa'ati then added: "Hafiz Ibn Kathir mentioned it in his Tafsir referring it
to Imam Ahmad, Ibn Marduwayh and to Hakim as in his book AlMustadrak." Hakim said: "This Hadith meets with the conditions set by
Muslim for his Sahih." Dhahabi approved it. Shami has mentioned it in his
Subul (2/485) that of those who reported it is Diya' in his Sahih, tracing it
through Ibn 'Abbas
358 Surat Al-Isra': 59.

It is also reported that they demanded that he transform a rock
of their choice to gold so that they could chip off it by and by and
save themselves the summer and winter trade journeys. They also
demanded that he perform a convincing miracle. So he showed
them the moon. It split. Imam Muslim is one of those who recorded
this event359

(vii) Attempts at Compromise
While the above was going on, the Quraysh also tried to work
out a compromise between Islam and pagandom. They were to drop
off some elements of their religion while the Prophet

was

expected to drop off some. Allah said:

"They hope that you would weaken so that they can also come
down."360
When they suggested that he worship their deities one day and
in return they worship his Deity the next day, Allah (§g) revealed the
chapter entitled The Disbelievers. It said:

"Say, O disbelievers. I do not worship what you worship. Nor do

They also tried to reach a compromise deal with his uncle. They

suggested that he adopt 'Umarah bin Walid bin Mughirah, in place
of Muhammad
and hand him over to them so that they could kill
him361
When Abu Talib fell ill and they felt that he might not survive,
some of them said to others, "Hamzah and 'Umar have embraced
Islam. Muhammad's religion has also spread into the distant
tribes. Let's go to Abu Talib and ask him to work out a
compromise between us arid Muhammad." When they went up
to him he addressed the Prophet ^ saying, "My dear nephew.
These are the leaders of your tribe. They have come here to give
you something, and take something from you." The Prophet ^
told him, "Yes. Let them accept a single word from me and they
will own the Arab world. And the non-Arab world will follow
their religion." According to another version, "The Arabs will
follow their religion and the non-Arabs will send them tribute."
They were over-pleased. They said, "A single word?" He said,
"Yes," Abu Jahl said, "Why, you can have ten words from us." He
replied, "You declare that there is no God except Allah and
abandon whatever else you worship." They began to clap their
hands. They said, "Muhammad. Do you want to replace several
gods with one? This is strange."
Then some of them told others, "This man will not give you a
bit of what you wish to get from him. Hold on to your religion until
God decides between us." With that they dispersed and Allah
revealed the first few passages of Surat Sad.3b2

361 Ibn Hisham (1/330) from a narration of Ibn Ishaq without a chain.
362 Reported by Ahmad: Al-Musnad (3/314-315/verified by Shakir), Shakir
said: "It has a Sahih chain." It is also in Tirmidhi's As-Sunan (8/361/H.
3230) where he said "This Hadith is Sahih and Hasan." Hakim has it in
his Al-Mustadrak (2/432/ and declared it trustworthy, which Dhahabi
approved. Also Tabari: Tafsir (23/125), Wahidi: Asbabun-Nuzul, (p. 209)
and Suyuti: Ad-Dun Al-Manthur (5/295) noting its recording in Ibn Abu
Shaybah, 'Abd bin Humayd, Nasa'i, Ibn Mundhir, Ibn Abu Hatim and
Ibn Marduwayh. Many others also recorded this Hadith. Of those of the
biographers who reported it: Ibn Ishaq, with an Interrupted (.Munqati')
chain, as in Sirat llvi Hisham (2/67-68) and As-Siyar wal-Maghdzi, p. 236.

(viii) Ridiculing the Qur’an, the One Who revealed it, and the
One Who brought it
Bukhari,363 Muslim,364 Tirmidhi365 and others have reported the
words of Ibn 'Abbas ^ concerning Allah's Words,

"And do not recite aloud in your prayers nor whisper (the
words),"
that these words were revealed at a time when the Prophet ^
performed his prayers aloud in Makkah. When he raised his voice in
the prayers, the pagans showed disrespect to the Qur'an, to the One
Who revealed it and to the one who brought it. Therefore Allah
forbid that he recite it aloud —that the pagans should hear him —nor
whisper it —that the Muslims cannot hear him. He asked him to
follow a middle course.
Ibn Ishaq366 has reported that when the Prophet

recited the

Qur'an aloud, the Quraysh dispersed, not willing to hear. If any of
them wished to hear the Qur'an, he concealed himself from others. If
he felt that someone might spot him listening to the Qur'an, he
moved off, in fear of persecution. When he felt that he could hear,
while others could not, because the Prophet's voice was low, then he

363 Al-Fath (17/299-300/H. 4722 and 4723). And the Hadith that follows (4723)
has the Tafsir of 'Aishah A which states that the Verse was revealed in
connection with supplication. Ibn Hajar said: "Nawawi, Tabari, and others
have preferred the opinion of Ibn 'Abbas; although there remains the
possibility that it was meant for the supplication to be made within the
prayer. Ibn Marduwayh reported a Hadith of Abu Hurayrah
which
says: "The Messenger of Allah used to raise his voice when supplicating
at the Ka'bah, and so it (this Verse) came down." The commentators have
other opinions..." Al-Fath (17/300).
364 Muslim (1/329/H. 145).
365 Sahih Sunan At-Tirmidhi (3/70/H. 3366-3367). Albani said: "Sahih by
consensus."

weakness of Dawud bin Husayn in his narration from Tkrimah, see AlKamil (3/959) and At-Tahdhib (3/181), At-Taqrib, p. 199.

pretended to hear nothing, although closely following him. There¬
fore, Allah (3s) revealed,

When the Muslims harshly criticized the Arab deities, the
disbelievers began to criticize Allah. Allah revealed.

"Do not criticize those who worship deities other than Allah,
or
o/n o/q
they will criticize Allah out of spite, without knowledge
367 Surat Al-Isra': 110.
368 Surat Al-An'am: 108
369 Tabari brought in many reports in his Tafsir (12/33-35/Shakir's verification)
as regard the reasons behind the revelation of this Verse. One of them
ending at Ibn 'Abbas*
and two Mursal reports as narratives of Qatadah
both with different chains; and a third Mursal report reaching Suddi. The
one reported of Ibn 'Abbas is Interrupted (.Munqati'), because it is one of the
narrations of 'Ali bin Abu Talhah reporting Ibn 'Abbas. As regards the
Disconnected (Mursal) reports of Qatadah, they are weak because Qatadah
did not hear from any Companion other than Anas. Suddi's report is also
weak because there were varied opinions about him. In addition to that, he
does not narrate but from very young of the Companions such as Ibn
'Abbas and Anas. Thus he is of the minors of the Followers. As for the
route that ends with Ibn 'Abbas, it is one of the best chains which Bukhari
depended on in his Sahih. The Sunan compilers accept the reports of 'Ali bin
Abu Talhah. See Dhahabi's At-Tafsir wal-Mufassirun (1/77-78).

190

The Prophet of Islam

Thus, although it was right to criticize the pagan deities, its
prohibition was necessary so that Allah was not ridiculed —which,
apart from other things, would bring down Allah's chastisement.370
This gives us the principle that sometimes a good thing has to
be given up from fear of evil repercussions. Hence we find the
report in trustworthy collections that the Prophet
said, "It is a
great sin that someone should curse his parents." They asked, "O
Messenger of Allah. How can one curse his parents?" He replied,
"Yes. He curses someone's father, so the other man curses his father.
He curses someone's mother, so the other man curses his
mother."371 He also said to 'Aishah
"If your people were not
so close to pagandom, I would have got the Ka'bah constructed on
Ibrahim's design."372

(ix) Consultations with the Jews

In order to contain the growth of Islam, the Quraysh also got in
touch with the Jews. They sent a delegation headed by Nadr bin
Harith along with 'Uqbah bin Abu Mu'ayt, to ask a few questions
by whose answers they could disprove the Prophet's authenticity.
They told them to ask him about the Seven Sleepers, Dhul-Qamayn,
and about the soul. Allah (M) defeated their purpose by answering
these questions through His revelations'"3 (see Surat Al-Kahf).

370 Ibn Kathir: Tafsir (3/306).
371 Muslim (1/92/H. 90), Ahmad: Al-Musnad (2/146, 195, 214, 216) a Hadith of
'Abdullah bin 'Amr. See Ibn Kathir: Tafsir (3/3080).
372 Reported by Bukhari, Muslim and others, see: Al-Bukhari, Kitabul-'Ilm, and
Muslim (2/968-973/H. 1333). The words here are those of Muslim.
373 This story has been reported by Ibn Ishaq without a chain— Ibn Hishdm
(1/371-372), Sahihut-Tirmidhi (3/69/H. 3361-3362) being a Hadith of Ibn
'Abbas. Albani said: ''The chain is Sahih." The narration has only a
question about the soul.
Ahmad reported it in his Musnad. See Al-Fathur-Rabbani (18/196-197) with
the same chain and text of At-Tirmidhi. See Dalail An-Nubuwwah by Bayhaqi
(1/269-270) as a report of Ibn Ishaq, with an Interrupted (Munqati') chain for
he kept back the name of the person from whom he took the report. But the
rest of the transmitters are trustworthy. Others have also reported it. The

191

(x) Efforts at Seduction
The Quraysh also tried their hands at seduction. They sent
across 'Utbah bin Rabi'ah to the Prophet #|. He said, "My dear
nephew. You are aware of your own honored position amongst us.
You have brought something terrible, splitting families thereof.
Listen to the suggestion I have brought. Maybe it will be acceptable
to you. If you are looking for wealth, well, we shall gather together a
lot of money for you to- ma,ke you the richest among us. If you are
after honor and prestige, we shall declare you our leader without
whose consultation nothing will be done. If you are looking for
kingship, we shall declare you our monarch. But if you feel this is
something that comes to you from within yourself, that you have no
control over and cannot resist it, then we shall get you treated at the
hands of a healer, at our cost, until you are healed."
When he was finished, the Prophet m read out the opening
Verses of chapter Fussilat until when he reached the Verse,

"But, if they turn away, say, 7 have warned you of a huge Cry
like the Cry of 'Ad and Thamud,"'374
— 'Utbah placed his hand on his mouth and stood up as if he feared
the Cry would overtake him. Then he returned to his people to tell
them that what Muhammad had brought was neither poetry nor
magic nor soothsaying.375 He suggested that the Prophet

be left

to himself.

Shaykhayn reported —as also Ahmad, Tirmidhi, Nasa'i, Ibn Jarir, Ibn
Mundhir and others attributed to Ibn Mas'ud 4b a report that the Jews asked
the Messenger of Allah about the soul when he was in Madinah and this
Verse was revealed, "And they ask you (O Muhammad
concerning the Ruh
(the spirit). Say: 'The Ruh (the spirit) is a Command of my Lord. And you have not
been given knowledge, but a'little."' Surat Al-Isra': 85. The two reports of Ibn
'Abbas and Ibn Mas'ud have been reconciled by stating that probably
several incidents led to the sending down of the revelation.
374 Surat Fussilat: 13.
375 This was reported by Ibn Ishaq with a Munqati' chain—Ibn Hisham (1/362363) and 'Abd bin Flumayd. See Al-Muntakhab min Musnad Abd bin

The Prophet of Islam

192

Other reports in Bayhaqi, Ibn Abu Shaybah and Ibn Humayd
say that when 'Utbah spoke, he also said, "And, if you want
women, we can give you ten women from the best of Quraysh
families to choose from."
Another report says that Walid bin Mughirah went to the
Prophet

to talk him about his mission. The Prophet

read out a

few Qur'anic Verses to him. That softened him. The news reached
Abu Jahl. He came up and told him, "Uncle. Your people are
thinking of collecting funds for you." Walid asked, "What for?" He
said, "To present it to you, for, you went to Muhammad to eat some
good food..." It was at that time that Walid commented on the
recitation that he had heard from the Prophet 5||, "By God. Its words
carry a strange sweetness, it is covered with beauty, its outer
appearance is rich, and its contents a fountainhead. Surely, it will
overcome and will not be overcome, it will destroy everything that
comes under (its sway)..."376

(xi) Threats
It was Abu Jahl's habit that whenever he heard about someone

Humayd, verified by Samarra'i and Sa'eedi, p. 337, H. 1123 with a
Connected (Muttasil) chain coming from Jabir^ —a report of Ibn Abu
Shaybah—the chain of narrators include Ajlah Kindi, whom Ibn Ma'in
and others trusted but Nasa'i and others distrusted. The rest of the
narrators were however trustworthy, the reason why Albani said that its
chain is Hasan. See Fiqhus-Sirah by Ghazali, p. 113, footnote. As for the
chain of Ibn Ishaq, Albani said that it is Hasan but Mursal. It was also
reported by Ibn Shaybah in his Musannaf (14/295-297), by a route other
than that of Ibn Ishaq. It too contains Ajlah. Bayhaqi also preserved it in
his Dalail (2/202-203) being the same narration as Ibn Abu Shaybah's;
and also Abu Nu'aym in Dalail (1/234). See Haythami in the Majma' (6/
20) in places mentioned there.
,76 Reported by Hakim in Al-Mustadrak (2/506-507) through a chain reaching
the first narrator. He said: “This Hadith has a Sahih chain which meets
with the conditions of Bukhari, although both he and Muslim did not
record it." Also preserved by Bayhaqi in Dalail (2/198-199) by the same
route, as well as other disconnected chains. After listing all the narrations
through different chains he said, “All these reports support each other."

From Birth to Emigration

193

having embraced Islam, he humiliated him and threatened him with
more severe measures. He would say, "You have abandoned the
religion of your father who is better than you. We shall try your
forbearance, humiliate you, and dishonor you." If he happened to
be a trader, he would say, "We will destroy your business and
wealth." If the man was weak, he would beat him up.377

(xii) Physical Assaults
When all the preceding measures did not bear out any result in
preventing the Prophet ^ and his followers from remaining firm in
their religion, the Quraysh opted for physical tortures.378
Their persecution measures became all the more harsh when
they found the Prophet ^ openly observe religious rituals such as
prayers in the Holy House. Once Abu Jahl asked his friends whether
Muhammad rubbed his face on the ground before them. (That is,
did he prostrate himself)? When they said yes, he swore, "By Lat
and 'Uzza. If I see him doing that I'll place my foot on his neck or
rub his face in the dust." A few days later he happened to come in
and find the Prophet in prayers. He stepped forward to accomplish
what he had promised. But he fell back trying to ward off something
with his hands. He was asked what the matter was. He said,
"Between me and him I found a pit of fire, ghosts and wings." The
Prophet 3i| said, "If he had come nearer, the angels would have tom
him to pieces." And Allah revealed.

him by his forelock ... Nay. Don't obey him, prostrate yourself
and get closer.”379
Bukhari380 has reported 'Urwah bin Zubayr as saying,

asked

'Abdullah bin 'Amr about the worst that the pagans did to the
Prophet <|§. He answered, 'I saw 'Uqbah bin Abu Mu'ayt going up
to the Prophet s|§ while he was in prayers. He threw his cloak
around his neck and began to pull hard. Abu Bakr happened to
come in. He shoved the man away. He pleaded, 'Do you want to kill
a man for saying Allah is his Lord, while he has also brought you
signs from his Lord?"'
oo-i

Bukhari

oon

and Muslim

have also recorded Ibn Mas'ud as

narrating, "Once Abu Jahl happened to be sitting by while the
Prophet jH was praying in the Holy Mosque. A camel's intestine,
slaughtered the day earlier, was lying by. Abu Jahl said, 'Who
volunteers to place the intestine on the Prophet's shoulders while he
is in prostration?' In response,383 the worst of their men got up and
placed the intestines on the Prophet's shoulder while his forehead
was on the ground. Everyone laughed so much that some had to
lean on others. I was there, watching all that. Had I someone in my
support, I would have removed the thing from the Prophet's back.
In the meanwhile, the Prophet ^ remained in prostration, not
raising his head, until someone ran to Fatimah ^ and informed her.
She was a little girl then, bigger than a child. She came along with
Juwayriyah. She removed the intestines, turned to them and cursed
them. When the Prophet 5|g had finished, he invoked Allah's

379 Surat Al-'Alaq: 6-19.
380Al-Fath (14/179/H. 3, 15/9-11/H. 3856). Ibn Ishaq has the report through
a Hasan chain, see Ibn Hisham (1/358-359). His Sirat has the report with
the same chain, pp. 229-230, being a narration of Yunus bin Bukayr.
381 Al-Fath (12/66/H. 2934).
Muslim (3/1418-1419/H. 1794). Apart from the two others also reported,
for example: Ahmad in his Musnad (I5/272/H. 3722). Shakir said it has a
Sahih chain. Also Ibn Ishaq in the Sirat, p. 211, and Ibn Hisham (2/65-66)
without a chain, and with a similar meaning as of the Shaykhayn and
Ahmad.
383 He is 'Uqbah bin Abu Mu'ayt, as has been clarified through a second
narration in Muslim (3/1419/H. 1794).

destruction on them in a loud voice. And, I tell you, I saw those he
named that day fallen at Badr, their corpses dragged by their feet
and hurled into a pit.”
Ibn Hajar3S4 said, "Abu Ya'la and Bazzar have reported
through a Sahih chain ending with Anas who said, "Once they
beat up the Prophet

until he went blank." Abu Bakr got up and

began crying out words, 'Woe unto you men. Will you kill a man
for saying his Lord is Allah?' So they let him go and began to beat
Abu Bakr."
Abu Lahab's son 'Utaybah also committed aggression against
the Prophet

He tore his shirt and spat on his face, except that his

spittle did not reach the Prophet's face. The Prophet i|§ supplicated
then and there, "O Allah. Set one of Your dogs upon this man." His
supplication was answered. 'Utaybah was torn to pieces by forest
beasts when he was in Zarqa' in Sham.385 Allah also shielded him
from Umm Jamil — Arwa or 'Awra', Harb's daughter, Abu Sufyan's
sister and wife of Abu Lahab — when she attempted to throw a rock
at him. This is reported by Bayhaqi in his Dala'il, through a few
weak reports that strengthen each other. She used to place thorns in
his path as alluded to by the Qur'an in the chapter titled "A/-

Masad.” This is the preferred explanation of the Verses.
Ahmad386 has reported that the Quraysh gathered together in
the Hijr area of the Haram. They swore in the name of their deities —
Lat, 'Uzza, Manat, Na'ilah and Isaf-that if they saw Muhammad
they would rise up as one body and strike him dead. Fatimah ^

384See Al-Fath (15/11/H. 3856). See also Musnad Abu Ya'la (3691) and Hakim
(3/67).
385 See Bayhaqi in Dala’il (2/338) who said regarding its chain: "This was
what 'Abbas bin Fadl said, and it is not strong."
3S6Al-Musnad (4/269/H. 2762). Shakir said: "Its chain is Sahih/’ and it is in
Majma‘uz-Zawa'id (8/228), saying, "Ahmad preserved it quoting two
chains one of which is authentic." And 1 say:
Both of them are
authentic." Musnad (5/163) has it through another chain reaching up to
Ibn 'Abbas. Shakir said it is Sahih. From the point of the chain, this story
reaches the status of Hasan. It could reach the Sahih status because of the
number of chains involved, and because its transmitters are trustworthyas Bawazir said in his book Marwiyyat Ghazwati Badr, p. 223.

The Prophet of Islam

informed the Prophet j|§ of their resolve. He came with a handful of
dust. Whoever it struck was found slaughtered at Badr.
Ahmad387 has also recorded Anas 4® that one night Jibril visited
the Prophet
He found him bleeding, and sad. Some Makkans
had beaten him up. Jibril asked him, "What happened?" The
Prophet
answered that so-and-so had beaten him up. Jibril asked
him, "Do you want me to show you a sign from your Lord?" The
Prophet #§ said, "Yes." Jibril looked at a tree at the far end of the
valley and said, "Beckon that tree." The Prophet
beckoned it. It
came and stood before him. Jibril said, "Order it to go back." He
ordered it to return and it complied. The Prophet jy| said, "That's
enough for me."
Ibn Kathir's388 opinion is that most of the physical assaults
that he suffered happened only after the death of his uncle Abu
Talib.
Abu Bakr 4® too received his own share of physical tortures
until he decided that he would go away to Abyssinia. '89
One day Abu Bakr 4®. stood up and addressed some people in
the Holy House. The pagans beat him blue and left bruises on his
body. Of those who beat him 'Utbah bin Rabi'ah was one. He hit
him so hard on the face with his shoes that those who saw him
couldn't make out between the nose and the mouth. Banu Taym
came in aid of Abu Bakr and so the Quraysh abandoned him. His
tribesmen carried him off in a cloak to his house. They thought he
was dead and swore that if he died, they would kill 'Utbah in
retaliation.390

387 Sa'ati said in Al-Fathur-Rabbani (20/220): "I could not find this Hadith in
other places except at Ahmad. And his narrators are trustworthy."
388 Al-Bidayah wan-Nihdyah (3/148); Shami: Subulul-Huda (2/572); Ibn Sa'd (1/
211).
389 See the Hadith in its complete form reported by Al-Bukhari/AFFath (10/4344/H. 2297). Ibn Hishdm reported it through a Hasan chain (2/14-15) as
well as 'Abdur-Razzaq in his Musannaf (5/384-389) and Bayhaqi in Dalail
(2/471-473). More material will follow at the point we deal with the story
of the Prophet's Hijrah to Ta'if.
390 See the story in Al-Bidayah wan-Nihayah (3/33-34).

The first person to recite the Qur'an aloud in the Ka'bah after
the Prophet m was 'Abdullah bin Mas'ud 4b. He did it despite being
warned of dangerous consequences. So when he attempted it, they
hit him in the face. When his companions reminded him of their
warning saying they had feared this, he replied, "These enemies of
Allah were never more pitiful in my sight than before. If you
wished, I could repeat this tomorrow." They said, "No. This is
enough. You have forced them to hear what they were unwilling to
hear."391

- . .

'Uthman bin 'Affan's uncle would wrap him up in a mat made
from palm leaves and then smoke him.392 It is said that when he
embraced Islam, his uncle Hakam bin Abu 'As bin Umaiyah caught
him and tied him up swearing that he would not release him until
he had forsaken his new religion. So 'Uthman 4® also swore that he
would never give up his religion. When his uncle saw his firmness
OQO

in his religion, he abandoned him.
When Mus'ab's mother learned of her son's Islam, she starved
him and then threw him out of the house. He was one of those who
had been brought up in luxuries. He dried up until his friends
carried him on bows because of his weakness.394
They also attempted to punish 'Umar bin Khattab 4® when he

AH). See Fadailus-Sahabah, edited by 'Abdus-Salam Tadmuri, p. 125. I
could not locate the first two narrators of this report. As for Muhammad
bin 'Imran Taymi, the third in line, Abu Hatim wrote about him in AlJarhu wat-Ta'dil (8/41) that he was an impressive person. As for
'Ubaydullah bin Ishaq Taymi, Ibn Hibban mentioned him as trustworthy
(7/142). However, his own acceptance is not accepted without a second
scholar agreeing with him. As regards Abdullah bin Muhammad bin
'Imran Taymi, Khatib Baghdadi mentioned him in Tdrikh Baghdad (10/62)
without criticizing him. In short, this report has not come to us through a
reliable chain.
391 Reported by Ibn Ishaq .through a Hasan chain; through 'Urwah bin
Zubayr. See: As-Siyar wal-Maghazi, p. 186.
392 Mansurpuri: Rahmatul-lil-'Alamin (1/52), however, we could not trace out
Mansurpuri's source.

embraced Islam. Ultimately they tried to kill him but the attempt
failed because Allah saved him at the hands of 'As bin Wa'il.39
'Uthman bin Maz'un

was also one of those who were

tortured. When he returned from his first migration journey to
Abyssinia, he was taken in protection by Walid bin Mughirah. But
when he saw how others were being tortured, he rejected his
protection. Labid bin Rabi'ah, the poet, visited Makkah. He recited
his poetry in a Quraysh assembly. When Labid said,

Lo. Every¬

thing is false save Allah," 'Uthman said, "You spoke the truth."
When Labid said, "And every blessing has to end," Uthman
remarked, "That's not true. Blessings of Paradise will be eternal."
Labid was upset. He complained, "O Quraysh. Your guest had
never been insulted before." One of those present said,

This is one

of those idiots who have abandoned their religion. So, don't take
him too serious." 'Uthman took the liberty to reply. An argument
ensued and the man boxed 'Uthman so hard that one of his eyes was
blackened. When Walid bin Mughirah saw him in that state he said,
"My nephew. You could have saved your eye the trouble if you had
remained in my protection." 'Uthman replied, "I am in the
protection of the One Who is more honorable and powerful than
you are, O Abu 'Abd Shams." Walid said, "Take it easy. If you wish
you can come back to my protection." 'Uthman said no.396
Similarly, Zubayr bin 'Awwam

was tortured by his uncle who

would tie up a mat to him and set it smoking, saying, "Abandon the
new religion." Zubayr would reply, "I shall never do that."397

395 This will be mentioned when reporting the story of 'Umar
Islam through a Hasan chain being a report of Ibn Ishaq.

embracing

396Reported by Ibn Ishaq with an Interrupted (Munqati') chain- Ibn Hishdm
(2/10-12); Bayhaqi in Dald'il (2/292-293) through Musa bin 'Uqbah. Musa
bin 'Uqbah however did not mention his source. Also recorded by
Tabarani in Al-Kabir (9/21-24) as a Disconnected (Mursal) Hadith from
'Urwah. This one has Ibn Lahiy'ah in the chain. Haythami quoted from
him in the Majma (6/32-34). Nonetheless, all these chains are weak, but
they indicate that the story has an origin.
397 Hakim: Al-Mustadrak (3/360). But both Hakim and Dhahabi did not issue
their opinion about it. In it falls Abu Aswad, who used to drop some
names. So, the report is a Mursal one coming down from 'Urwah. See Abu
Nu'aym in the Hilyah (1/89) with a Mursal chain of trustworthy narrators.

Abu Jahl locked up his own brother Salamah bin Hisham bin
Mughirah when he returned from Abyssinian emigration. He also
denied him food. Salamah managed to escape some twelve years
later, when the Prophet ^ was in the fifth year of his migration.
Salamah joined him during the battle of the Ditch. Ibn Sa'd has
reported this in his At-Tabaqat (4/130) as has Dhahabi in his

Tarikhul-Islam." It is this Salamah bin Hisham for whose release the
Prophet Hg used to supplicate in his special prayers (iQunut) at
Madinah.
Makkah in fact was not the only place where Muslims were
tortured. Some of those who had embraced Islam from the desert
tribes were meted out the same treatment. Ibn Sa'd398 has recorded
that when Umm Sharik Ghuzayyah bint Jabir bin Hakim embraced
Islam along with her husband, and her husband migrated along
with Abu Hurayrah and a few others, her husband's people came to
her and asked her if she too was on the religion of her husband.
When she said yes, they swore that they would punish her. So,
whenever they traveled from one place to another, they put her on
top of the wildest mount. Then they would give her some bread and
honey but withhold water from her. Once they left her in the desert
until she lost her sense. She could hardly hear or see. They repeated
this for three days. On the third day they again demanded that she
give up her religion. She couldn't speak out anything because of
what she was passing through. She only pointed her finger to the
heaven meaning "One God." Then Allah sent her a bucket of water
as a miracle. That became the reason for the Islam of her husband's
people, all of whom chose to migrate to the Prophet
Abu Dharr Ghifari is another case in point. When he entered
into Makkah looking for the Prophet i|, he was beaten up by the
Makkans so severely that he fainted. He would have all but died if
'Abbas bin 'Abdul-Muttalib had not intervened.399

398 At-Tabaqat (8/155-157) being a narration of Waqidi who was abandoned
and hence the chain is very weak.
399 This is a part of a Hadith that tells the story of how Abu Dharr &
embraced Islam. By consensus: Al-Bukhari/Al-Fath (14/33/H. 3522) and
Muslim (4/1920/H. 2473) and (4/1923-1924/H. 2474).

(xiii) Torture of the Slaves

The pagans let loose their utmost fury against the slaves
because they had no one to protect them. They were subjected to the
severest kind of tortures.
These poor souls went through such harsh treatment that Allah
(H) allowed them to speak out disbelief, if the pain went beyond
endurance. Sa'eed bin Jubayr asked Ibn 'Abbas if the torture
inflicted by the pagans on the slaves had reached such level that
they were allowed to say out what would help them escape. He
replied, "Yes, very much so. By Allah. One of them was beaten up
so hard, kept hungry and thirsty for so long, that he was unable to
sit upright. In that state they would say out whatever was asked of
them. They'd be asked, 'Are Lat and 'Uzza deities besides Allah or
not?' They'd say in reply, 'Yes, they are.' They said that only to
escape further torture."400 Ibn Kathir401 has said that it is about
these that Allah (fig) revealed,

C&J

"Whoever disbelieved in Allah after his faith, except one who is
forced, although his heart is filled with faith, (such men are
excused) but not someone who is quite at ease with disbelief; upon
such is Allah's anger and for them is a great punishment."
Ibn Mas'ud

said, "The first seven who announced their Islam

were: The Prophet, Abu Bakr, 'Ammar and his mother Sumaiyah,
Suhayb, Bilal and Miqdad. As for the Prophet

he was protected

400 Reported by Ibn Ishaq — Ibn Hishdm (1/396). He specifically mentioned
having heard it from him. However, in his chain falls Hakim bin Jubayr
who was weak as Ibn Hajar said in At-Taqrib, p. 176, and Ibn Kathir
quoted it in Al-Bidayah wan-Nihayah (3/65) through Ibn Ishaq using this
chain.
401 Al-Bidayah wan-Nihayah (3/65). And the concerned Verse is from Surat AnNahl: 106.

by his uncle. As for Abu Bakr, his tribesmen prevented his torture.
But for the rest, the pagans seized them. They made them wear steel
coat of arms and placed them in the sun. Then there wasn't one of
them but who gave them what they wanted of the words, except
Bilal. He showed no respect to his body in the way of Allah. And he
showed no respect to his torturers. Finally, they handed him over to
the urchins who dragged him around (with a rope in his neck) in the
valleys of Makkah while he kept saying, 'One. One.'"402

Yasir's Family

This family is cited as an example in history works of what
people had to go through in defense of their faith. Banu Makhzum
would bring them out into the hot sun at noon and torture them
there.403
Once the Prophet #§ passed by them while they were
undergoing tortures. He said, "Good news to you, O family of
Yasir. Your abode is in Paradise."404

402 Reported by Ahmad in Al-Musnad (5/319/H. 3832/Shakir). Shakir said:
"Its chain is Sahih." Dhahabi mentioned it in the Sirat, pp. 217-218, and
said: "It is a Sahih Hadith." He traced it in other ways and therefore one
might look into him if interested. Dhahabi also mentioned it in his Sirat, p.
317-318, and said, "A trustworthy Hadith." Hakim traced it in AlMustadrak (3/284) and said that its chain is Sahih. Dhahabi agreed with
him Abu Nu'aym also recorded it in Al-Hilyah (1/149) as also Ibn Majah:
Sahih Sunan Ibn Majah (1/30, Albani). Albani said: Hasan Bayhaqi in
Dalail (2/281-282) and Ibn Kathir in Al-Biddyah wan-Nihayah (3/64) where
he said: "Thawri reported it from Mansur through Mujahid as a
Disconnected (Mursal) report."
403 Ibn Hisham (1/395) as a narration of Ibn Ishaq without a chain. As regards
his drowning in water, see Sirat Ibn Ishaq, p. 192, the Hadith of Ibn Sinn.
404 Reported by Hakim in- Al-Mustadrak (3/388) as Jabir's Hadith. He said.
»Sahih according to Muslim's conditions.'' Dhahabi agreed to it. But the
two verifiers of Sirat Ibn Hisham were confused when they said l tha
Dhahabi had no comments about it- Sirat Ibn Hisham (1/3 j.
ay
also mentioned it in the Majma (9/293) and said: "Reported by Tabararu
in Al-Awsdt, and its narrators are trustworthy
Albani described i
Sahih and Hasan, as in the footnote of Fiqhus-Sirah by Ghazali, pp. 107-108.

The Prophet of Islam

It was from this family that the first martyr in Islam emerged.
It was 'Ammar's mother, Sumaiyah bin Khaiyat. Abu Jahl threw at
her a javelin that struck her under the navel and she died on the
spot405
Yasir died due to tortures. His son 'Abdullah was hit with a
weapon.406 He too died. 'Ammar was kept in tortures, until they
forced him to speak out words of disbelief. Most commentators407 of
the Qur'an are of opinion that the Verse:

"Whoever disbelieved in Allah after his faith, except one who is

It was also reported by Ibn Ishaq — Ibn Hisham (1/395) and its words are:
"Be patient O house of Yasir, for Paradise is your destiny." Dhahabi
mentioned it in his Sirat, p. 218, through Hisham Dastuwa'i, he from Abu
Zubayr and he from Jabir. However, Abu Zubayr is known for dropping
the name of the Companions, while sometimes he narrated through
unknown persons. However, what of the reports we have brought,
strengthen the report of Abu Zubayr, raising it to the level of Hasan li
Ghayrihi. See Al-Fathur-Rabbani (20/220).
405 Reported by Ahmad: Al-Musnad (1/404, through a Mursal report of
Mujahid. Bayhaqi reported by the same route in Dalail (2/282); and
Dhahabi in As-Siratun-Nabawiyyah, p. 218. Ibn Ishaq also reported it—Ibn
Hisham (1/395). Therein are the words, "As for his mother Umm Yasir,
they killed her, while she refused anything but Islam." The report is in Allsdbah (35/648), under the biography of Yasir Absi and (4/334), biography
of Sumaiyah; Baladhuri: AnsabuTAshrdf
406 Ibn Hajar said that in Al-Isabah (3/648) and he attributed it to Kalbi's son,
under the Tafsir coming from Abu Salih, and he from Ibn 'Abbas.
However, in Hadith, Ibn Kalbi stands rejected.
407 Ibn Jawzi mentioned four opinions in Az-Zad (4/495) about whom this
Verse was revealed. One opinion is that it was in reference to 'Ammar bin
Yasir. This was reported by Mujahid through Ibn 'Abbas 4. So said
Qatadah. Ibn Kathir said in his Tafsir (4/525): "This is what Sha'bi, Abu
Malik and Qatadah said." Then he added that 'Awfa also transmitted
from Ibn 'Abbas that this was revealed in connection with 'Ammar.
As for Ibn Jarir, who quoted through Abu 'Ubaydah bin Muhammad bin
Ammar bin Yasir. As for his words viz., "The pagans took 'Ammar bin

408

was revealed in reference to 'Ammar bin Yasir.

409

Bilal
Bilal was a slave of the Banu Jumah. He was the son of Rabah.
His mother was called Hamamah. He was said to be an Abyssinian.
Some say he was from Nubia 410
He was a man of pure heart and a true faith. His master
Umaiyah bin Khalaf would bring him out into the open at mid¬
afternoon, throw him on the ground, and place a rock on his chest.
He would say, “You'll lie there and die, or deny Muhammad and

Yasir and tortured him until he came close to uttering what they desired
of him. So he inquired with the Prophet 0. The Prophet 0 asked him,
'How do you find your heart?' He said, 'Satisfied with faith. The Prophet
0 told him, 'If they repeat, you also repeat/'' Albani declared this report
for the reasons that it does not reach the Prophet 0. But he thought that
report as Sahih which deals with the question of 'Ammar bin Yasir as the
cause of revelation. For, it came through several ways, which all were
traced by Ibn Jarir. See footnotes to Fiqhus-Sirah of Ghazali, p. 108. The
examination of the Hadith's transmission has worthy points of note. So,
one may look at them. We have forsaken it, among many others at
different places, both Albani's as well as others, for reasons of length.
408 Surat An-Nahl: 106.
409 Ibn Hajar said in Al-Fath (9/281): "'Ammar was an Arab from the tribe of
'Ansi, who was not taken as a slave, but his father took to dwelling m
Makkah. He allied himself to Banu Makhzum. They made him marry
Sumaiyah who was one of their freed slaves. She gave birth to 'Ammar. It
is possible therefore that the polytheists treated 'Ammar the way they did
because his mother was a former slave.
Ibn Ishaq said in Sirat p. 192: "Yasir was a slave of Banu Bakr of Banu
Ashia'. They bought hinl from them and made him marry Sumaiyah the
mother of 'Ammar. Then they freed both Sumaiyah as well as 'Ammar."
See his life in biography works.
410 Ibn Hajar: Al-Fath (14/248) the Book on the Fadail Ashabun-Nabi 0, chapter:
The Virtues of Bilal bin Rabah. As regards his being captive during the preIslamic times, see the narration of Al-Bukhdri (9/280-281/The Book of Buyu ).
The chapter content is, however a Suspended (Mu'allay) report.

come back to the worship of Lat and 'Uzza. Bilal would reply, "One,
One."411
Baladhuri412 has a report of 'Amr bin As, "I saw Bilal being
tortured in the desert. If a piece of meat was kept on him it would
have got fried. But Bilal was saying, 'I deny Lat and 'Uzza/ That
angered Umaiyah. He went on increasing the torture until Bilal fell
unconscious."
Baladhuri413 has also reported through Mujahid: "They tied a
rope around Bilal's neck and ordered the urchins to drag him
around in Makkan valleys. While dragged around, Bilal would only
say, "One, One."
Baladhuri414 also reports Bilal & as having said, "Once they
kept me thirsty for a day and night and then took me out on a hot
day into the desert to torture me."
When Abu Bakr 4* saw him in that state, he bargained his
price, bought him and freed him. Ibn Abu Shaybah415 and

Ibn Ishaq without a chain-Ibn Hisham (1/392). But this Hadith is
supported by Ibn Mas ud's which was mentioned previously and which is
a Sahih Hadith.
412 Ansdbul-Ashraf (1/185).
413 Ibid.
414 Ibid (1/186).
415 Ibn Hajar said this in Al-Fath (4/248). Ibn 'Abdul-Barr reported it in Al-Isti'db
(2/34) with a Strong (Qawi) chain as Dhahabi said in Siyar A'larn An-Nubala'
(1/353). See it traced in Al-Qasimiyah, p. 367. Ibn Hajar stated other opinions
in connection with his freedom: Al-Fath (9/281). Ibn Jawzi mentioned in AzZdd (9/146) the reason behind the revelation of this Verse: "Certainly, your
efforts are diverse." One is the Hadith of Ibn Mas'Qd to the effect that Abu
Bakr bought Bilal for a garment and ten coins of silver. He also said that
Wahidi reported it in Ashdbun-Nuzul, p. 335. Suyuti also reported it in AdDurr (6/358) as a narration of Ibn Abu Hatim while Ibn 'Asakir quoted
through Ibn Mas'ud. Baghawi and Khazin mentioned it without a chain. Ibn
'Abdul-Barr quoted several Ahadith in connection with his purchase. One
might see it in Al-Isti'db (1/32-34). They are Disconnected (Mursal) reports
that strengthen each other. They have been traced out in Al-Qasimiyah, pp.
368-369. There are a few other reports that the writer of Al-Qasimiyah has
traced from other books. See pp. 370-372.

Baladhuri41b have reported through trustworthy chain of narrators
that Abu Bakr bought him for fifty pieces of silver while he lay
buried under a heap of stones."417

Khabbab bin Aratt 4*

His full name was Khabbab bin Aratt bin Jandalah bin Sa'd bin
Khuzaymah ... bin Tamim Tamimi. Some say he was Khuza'i.418 He
was enslaved in the pre-Islamic days and sold out in Makkah. But
there are conflicting reports. In any case, under the sponsorship of
Banu Zuhrah he worked as a smith. He specialized in sword¬
making.419 He was one of the earliest to embrace Islam.
As he embraced Islam he encountered a variety of difficulties
affecting his person and financial situation like several other weak
Muslims 420 They pulled him by his hair, twisted his head hard, and
placed him on hot rocks with stones on him making him unable to
rise 421 Once they lit a fire and flung him on to it. It was his back
which put that fire out. Long after, he showed his burnt back to
'Umar bin Khattab ^J22 He also told him that they used to make
416 Ansabul-Ashraf (1/186).
417 Al-Bukhdri/Al-Fath (14/249/H. 5537). Ibn Ishaq reported through a Hasan
chain that he exchanged him against a black boy -Ibn Hishdm (1/393).
418 ibn Hishdm mentioned it without a chain (1/319). See it in Al-Isdbah (1/
416).
419 This was mentioned in his story with 'As bin Wa'il. See Al-Bukhari, Muslim
and others as we shall discuss presently.
420 See Ahmad: Fadd'ilus-Sahdbah (1/182) - a Hadith of Ibn Mas'ud 4* which
was mentioned earlier. It was mentioned that Khabbab 4= was one of
those taken by the polytheists and tortured by covering their bodies with
metallic shields and steel shirts, then throwing them on hot rocks. Ibn Sa'd
(3/165) mentioned that he was one of those who were deemed weak and
tortured. Its transmission chain is Disconnected (Mursal) but all other
transmitters are trustworthy except Waqidi. Abu Nu'aym mentioned this
in the Hilyah (1/143) through an authentic chain as demonstrated by the
writer of Qasimiyah, p. 375.
421 Ibn Jawzi: Talcjih Fuhum Ahlil-Athar, p. 60.
422 Abu Nu'aym reported it in Hilyah (1/144) with a Mursal chain coming
through Sha'bi. If Sha'bi's hearing from Khabbab is proven true, then the
Hadith will be fully connected and hence authentic. But at the moment the

him lie down on hot rocks. But, despite all that, his tormentors got
nothing out of him 423
His encounter with 'As bin Wa'il is well known. Preserved by
Bukhari424 and Muslim,425 it reports Khabbab as saying, "I was a
blacksmith in Makkah. I had made a sword for 'As bin Wa'il. I went
up to him seeking my money. He told me, 'I will not pay up until
you have denounced Muhammad.' I said, 'I am not going to deny
him until Allah deals you death and then raises you again.' He said,
'If Allah killed me and then raised me again, and if I happened to
have wealth and offspring, then perhaps I'll pay up." So Allah
revealed:

^

"Have you considered the man who denies Our signs and says, 'I
shall surely be given wealth and children.' Has he the knowledge
of the Unseen or has he made a pact with the All-Merciful?”426

Hadith is Hasan because of the problems as discussed in connection with
his torture. Ibn Sa'd mentioned in At-Tabaqat (3/165) as a Hadith of Abu
Layla Kindi that Khabbab showed 'Umar some marks on his back caused
by the torture of the polytheists. Its chain is of Hasan grade. Ibn Majah
reported this Hadith in his Sunan/Foreword (153). And its transmission
chain is reliable as said Busiri in his Zawa'id. Albani also treated it
authentic: Sahih Sunan Ibn Majah (1/13/H. 153). He also hinted at it in one
of his works that has not yet seen the light of the day: Sahihus-SiratunNabawiyyah. For rest of the reports see in Baladhuri: Ansabul-Ashraf (1 /175179). Baladhuri also reported from this very origin (1/176) that he was
named Aratt because of his stammering when he spoke the Arabic
language.
423 Abu Nu'aym reported it in Hilyah (1/144) with a Sahih chain.
'4~4Al-Fath (18/31/H. 4733), also see other reports in the same chapter. The
words here are those of Bukhari.
Muslim (4/2153/H. 2795). Al-Bukhdri has several reports of the same
meaning. The story was mentioned by Ibn Ishaq without a chain; and Ahmad
(5/110), and At-Tirmidhi (8/308-309). See: Sahihut-Tirmidhi (3/76/H. 3385).
Albani said, "Agreed upon." He also signals what we have pointed out.

When their torment became unbearable Khabbab
and other
weak Muslims complained to the Prophet
427 He was resting under
the shadow of the Ka'bah. They said to him, "Will you not help us?
Will you not pray for us?" He replied, "There were men among the
previous nations for one of whom they'd dig a hole in the ground (and
bury him). They'd then bring a saw and slit his head into two. But that
would not deter him from his religion. Another would have steel
combs reaching his bones tearing off his flesh and muscles, but that
would not deter him from his religion. By Allah. This affair will end
with a rider riding from San'a' to Hadramaut with none to fear except
either Allah, or wolves on his sheep. But you are hasty."

Other Unsupported Slaves
Of the unsupported ones, the following were some: HamamahBilal's mother, 'Amir bin Fuhayrah, Umm 'Ubays, Zinnirah,
Nahdiyyah and her daughter, a slave-girl of Banu 'Adi whom 'Umar
bin Khattab & used to beat up before he himself embraced the faith.
Abu Bakr & gradually freed all those mentioned above.429
When Abu Quhafah saw his son freeing these (physically) weak
slaves, he objected saying, "My son. The slaves you free are weak
ones. If you freed the strong ones, they would help and support you
later." Abu Bakr & replied, "Father. My objective is Allah's
Pleasure." It was in connection with this that the following Verses
were revealed which said.

"As for him who gave, feared, and acknowledged the good, for
him We shall ease the path of ease..."

428 See Ibn Kathir: Al-Fusui fi Ikhtisar Siratur-Rasul, p. 87, Ibn Hisham (1/393394) being a report of Ibn Ishaq without a chain. It was mentioned earlier
that Abu Bakr 4* had freed Bilal
429 See Ibn Hisham (1/394) that has a report from Ibn Ishaq without a chain;
and Sirat Ibn Ishaq, p. 191, also without a chain, as also Baladhuri: AnsabulAshraf (1/158, 190, 194, 196).

It should so happen that Zannirah lost her eyesight after Abu

no comments on this statement. Ibn Ishaq also reported it as it can be

Companions have to undergo the tortures? Why didn't Allah
save His soldiers and His Prophet Ig from it?” The first answer
is that man is a responsible being in this life. He is required to
spread the word of Islam and struggle to establish the truth.
This is a requirement that man cannot escape from, being what
he is: Allah's slave. The Qur'an has said.

‘We have not created men and jinn hut to worship Me."434
This responsibility and devotion to Allah require that man bear
the difficulties and tortures when they come along.
Trials and tribulations are the means by which the true and the
false can be distinguished. Allah (:$g) said

"Alif Lam. Mim. Do the people reckon that they will be left alone
if they said, ‘We have believed' and they will not be tried? Verily

He also said:

“Do you reckon that you will enter Paradise when Allah has not

The above being the realities, a Muslim should never despair
when faced with some trials. In fact, the opposite is true. Muslims
ought to congratulate each other whenever faced with trials and

tribulations hoping that such things would make achievement of
their goals surer and faster. This is clear from Allah's Words:

^ 'o\

"Do you reckon you will enter Paradise when the like of what
visited those before you has not yet come to you? They were
visited by evils, and pain, and were shaken until the Messenger
and his men cried out, 'When will be Allah's help?' Lo. Allah's
help is near at hand?"437'438
2.

Scholars agree between themselves that when faced with
hardships, one could opt to choose the difficult option rather
than the easy way out. It is also agreed that it is better,
especially for the scholars and leaders, to choose the difficult
option rather than the easy one.439 Further, it is also agreed that
the common people taking the easy way out is not a sign of
their weakness in faith. This is deduced from the Prophet's
advice to 'Ammar bin Yasir, "If they repeat (the tortures) you
may repeat (the words of disbelief)." In other words, he told
him to speak out words in praise of the pagan deities so long as
his heart was steady with true faith.440
Says Ibn Kathir,441 "Scholars are one in opinion that it is

437 Suraht Al-Baqaralv. 214.
438 See Buti: Fiqhus-Sirah, pp. 85-87.
439 See Mawsili: Al-Ikhtiyaru li-Ta'lilil-Mukhtari fil-Fiqhil-Hanafi (2/104), a Dar
Al-Ma'rifah print, Beirut. Taken from Shaykh Zuhayr Salim: 'Atharat wa
Saqatat, p. 438.
440 See Shaykh Zuhayr Salim, pp. 39-40.
441 See: Tafsir Ibn Kathir (4/525-526). Habib bin Zayd bin 'Asim bin 'Umar
Ansari Muzani was the son of the great Muslim lady Umm 'Umarah,
Nusaibah bint Ka'b Muzaniyyah. (See Isabah, 1/306-307). He was one of
those who took the pledge during the second 'Aqabah Pledge. His story in
connection with Musaylimah was reported by Ibn Ishaq through a chain
rated Hasan li Dhatihi (Ibn Hisharn, 2/120). It says that Musaylimah got
hold of him but not how. Ibn 'Abdul-Barr said in Isti'ab on the margin of

From Birth to Emigration

211

allowed for a Muslim undergoing tortures to say words that will
help him escape punishment, as it is also allowed that he stay firm,
uncompromising, as Bilal
did, despite the tortures. We have
another example in Habib bin Zayd Ansari. When Musaylimah the
Liar asked, "Do you bear witness that Muhammad is a Messenger?"
He would reply, "Yes." But when he asked, "Do you bear witness
that I am Allah's Messenger?" Zayd would reply, "I can't hear."
Musaylimah cut him into pieces but he stayed firm. The important
thing of course is that at heart a Muslim remains firm on his religion,
even if that leads to death —as Ibn 'Asakir has said in the
biographical sketch of 'Abdullah bin Hudhafah Sahmi."
On the same topic, Ibn Jawzi has said,442 "It is allowed that one
speak out the word of disbelief (when tortured). From Ahmad we
have two reports on this issue. One of them says that if a man fears
his life or limb, he might speak out words of disbelief. A second
condition is that the threats should take active form. In that
situation, it is allowed to dissemble disbelief, although it is
preferable that one doesn't take that option."
Obviously, there are kinds and varieties of believers. In
accordance with the weakness or strength of their trust in Allah,
their reactions will also vary. History will not send into oblivion the
example that the first generation Muslims set for the rest of the
Ummah for all times and place.
The enemies of Islam will never, in any place, at any time, desist
from employing any means to put out the light of Islam and destroy
its message and its bearers. But, surely, they won't be able to employ
any means that the Quraysh did not employ against the weak
Makkan Muslims. It will consume a lengthy space to describe all the
varieties of torture that were employed. We mentioned a few by
way of illustration to demonstrate what happens when Islam stands
up against those deviant societies that refuse to accept the Divine
guidance.

Isabah (1/328) that the Prophet jgj had sent him to Musaylimah the Liar.
But he did not write the chain and we do not have a confirmed report
about it.
442 Zadul-Masir, (4/496).

The Prophet of Islam

212

It was bv the wisdom of Allah (H) that the Quraysh should
repeatedly seek to reach a compromise solution with the lYophet y
over whatever aims and objectives they thought he secretly
harbored behind his ostensible prophetic call. The Prophet's refusal
to accept every offer that was made to him went to demonstrate and
for the historical records, that he had no objectives in mind, save a
single one, viz., the establishment of Islam. In this way all the roads
and passages for the doubters and skeptics were closed. His
uncompromising attitude during the course of years that followed
also confirmed that he had no other objective save the establishment
of Islam.443

(xiv) Efforts to Check Muslim Migration

When some of the Muslims migrated to Abyssinia the Quravsh
sent teams behind them to prevent their entry into the land of their
desire. And when the Muslims succeeded in entering it. and
establishing themselves in sizable numbers, they sent a delegation to
try and get them back.
They even tried to bribe the Abyssinian ruler Najashi and went
as far as playing a trick on him, but failed in their efforts. The details
of this will come later when we speak of migration.
(xv) Boycott

We shall speak of this also a little later. (See section ‘General
Boycott' in the next pages).

The Meeting Place of the Prophet

and His Companions

The Prophet % used to meet secretly with the early converts in
44'See Buti: Fiqhus-Sirah, p. 90.

From Birth to Emigration

213

order to pass on the latest revelations that he had received. By the
fifth year of his commissioning, he had chosen the house of one of
his followers for this purpose. It was the house of Arqam bin
Arqam.444 This meeting place was kept secret because several early
converts had kept their faith secret.445 This shows that when the
interests of Islam and Muslims require such a measure, there is no
harm in resorting to it. This policy of secrecy is in fact, quite a
recurring theme in the life of the Prophet j|g.
As to the question why the Prophet 5g| chose that particular
place, Mubarakpuri446 has answered that Arqam was not known as
a Muslim. He was of the Banu Makhzum who competed with and
opposed Banu Hashim in many things. Therefore, no one would
suspect that the Prophet ^ was conducting meetings in the heart of
the enemy's stronghold. Further, Arqam was just about 16 when he
embraced Islam. Nobody would guess that meetings would be held
in his house in preference to other known important Muslims.
It might also be noted that Arqam's house was near Mount Safa,
normally a crowded place. It was difficult to notice people's
movements and guess that a meeting was taking place somewhere
around. Even when the pagans suspected that the Muslims were
meeting somewhere, all they could guess was that they probably
met somewhere around Mount Safa.447
As pointed out earlier, the efforts at secrecy were very

444 Darul-Arqam is now known as Darul-Khayzuran at Safa, as mentioned by
Shami in his Subul (2/430). Major General Ibrahim Rifat Pasha said in
Mir'atul-Haramayn (1/1992), "This house lies in an alley that lies on the
left side to the one ascending Safa. Its door opens to the east through
which one enters into an open space of about 8 meter length.
445 See the story of Abu Bakr's sermon in the Haram and the pagans beating
him. It says that Umm Jamil, daughter of Khattab denied any knowledge
of Abu Bakr or the Prophet im, and the whereabouts of Abu Bakr, see Al¬
ii i day ah ivan-Nihayah 3/33-34).

commonly employed by the Prophet j|§ throughout his life. This
being another case in point.

The First Emigration to Abyssinia
Persecutions of the minor type had begun by the middle of the
fourth year after the Prophet's commissioning. But it gathered heat
day after day, month after month. By the middle of the fifth year it
became unbearable to stay in Makkah. So the Muslims seriously
began to consider ways by which they could escape the tortures. It
was during those difficult days that the Qur'anic chapter Al-Kahf
was revealed in reply to a few questions that the pagans had raised.
It comprised three stories, all of which contained subtle hints from
Allah to those who had believed in Him. The story of the sleepers in
the Cave hinted at the Muslims that they could migrate from the
pagan concentrated places if they feared their faith. One of the
passages said:

"(The youths told each other) And when you have sought to
distance yourself from them and what they worship apart from
Allah, then retreat to the Cave. Allah will spread out for you His
mercy and prepare your affairs with facility.',448
The story of Musa and Khidr conveyed the message that it is
not at all necessary that the succession of events should not lead to
normal consequences. Sometimes the consequences can be entirely
different from what is apparent. In this was concealed the subtle
message that the war that will be waged against Muslims by pagans
will have entirely unexpected results, and soon the tyrannous
Quraysh —if they didn't believe — would be seized by those very
Muslims who were so weak at the beginning that they were
expelled.

448 Surat Al-Kahf. 16.

From Birth to Emigration

215

Dhul-Qarnayn's story has the lesson that the earth is Allah's. He
bequeaths it to whom He wills of His slaves and that true success
lies in the path of faith and not in that of disbelief. It was also to say
that Allah has always sent one of His slaves, whenever the need
arose, to rescue the weak ones from the tyrannies of the Ya'juj and
Ma'juj of the time, and the earth will be ultimately bequeathed to the
righteous slaves of Allah.449
Then came down chapter Az-Zumar. It also hinted at migration
to Abyssinia. It announced .that Allah's earth is not constricted. It

"Those who do good in this life, there is good (recompense for
them). And Allah's earth is vast. Surely, those who demonstrate
patience and perseverance, they will be recompensed without
measure."450
It was in these conditions, and in this background, that the
Muslim emigration to Abyssinia began.451
Ibn Ishaq452 has reported the following as narrated by Umm
Salamah '4k She said, "When Makkah became too narrow for us.
449 See the story in Verses 83-97 from Surat Al-Kahf especially Verse 94: "They
said: ‘O Dhul-Qamayn! Verily Ya'juj and Ma'juj (Gog and Magog) are doing
great mischief in the land. Shall we then pay you a tribute so that you might
erect a barrier between Us and them?”
450 Surat Az-Zumar. 10.
451 As regards the signs in Surat Al-Kahf and Surat Az-Zumar, see Ar-Rahiq,
pp. 105-106, which are indeed fine remarks. As for trial in religion and
that it was the main reason behind the first emigration to Abyssinia, see:
Al-Bukhari/Al-Fath (10/43-44/H. 2297). Also see 'Awdah's article, p. 299
and pages that follow, for- it is quite comprehensive. See also Ibn Kathir:
Al-Bidayah wan-Nihdyah (3/73).
452 As-Siyar wal-Maghazi, p. 213 —a narration of Yunus bin Bukayr; Ibn Hishdm
(1/413) for a narration of Bakka'i, which goes through a Hasan chain. It is
a long report dealing with the first emigration to Abyssinia. This chapter
will present a few of its parts. Several others have mentioned it apart from
Ibn Ishaq.

The Prophet of Islam

216

where the Companions of the Prophet *y§ were tortured and
persecuted, and the Prophet
could not save them although he
himself was not harmed because of his family connections and,
especially, because of his uncle, so that he was not as freely targeted
with what would give him pain ... when they perceived that, then
the Prophet ^ himself told them, 'The Abyssinian lands are ruled
by a king who does not oppress anyone. Therefore, go forth and
seek refuge in his lands until Allah finds a way out of the present
situation.' Accordingly, we started going there assembling ourselves
in ones and twos. And, we truly discovered that we had gone to a
good land, good neighbours, in peace over our religion and fearful
of no oppression.”
Ibn Sa'd453 provides the details. He said that the Muslims
slipped out of Makkah secretly. The first batch was made up of
eleven men and four women. When they had assembled in
Shu'ay bah, they luckily found two merchant ships about to sail.
The ship owners agreed to transport them to Abyssinia for half a
dinar each. That was in Rajab, the sixth year after the Prophet ^
was commissioned.454 The Quraysh went after them in hot pursuit
following their tracks. But they reached the shore to learn that the
ship had just sailed out and that everyone had escaped.
Another report, also in Ibn Sa'd,455 gives us the names of
twelve men and four women. Ibn Sayyidin-Nas456 agreed with
him over the names except that he added the name of a fifth
woman Umm Kulthum bint Suhayl bin 'Amr, the wife of Abu

453 At-Tabaqdt (1/204). Its chain has three defects: presence of Waqidi,
unknowability of 'Ubaydullah bin 'Abbas and the fact that it is
Disconnected (Mursal).
454 This conforms the saying of Ibn Ishaq that the first Hijrah took place
before the boycott, being contrary to Musa bin 'Uqbah's opinion. See Ibn
Hisham (1/430), and Ibn Kathir in Al-Biddyah (3/74) where he said: “Musa
bin 'Uqbah claimed that the first Hijrah to Abyssinia took at the time
when Abu Talib and his allies entered into the valley (where they were
locked)."

Sabrah. Ibn Ishaq457 however maintained that they were ten men
and four women and that Ibn Mas'ud was not one of them. In his
place he mentioned Abu Hatib, although not without some
reservation, employing such words as, “It is claimed ..."
Dhahabi45* agrees with him in the number of men and women
but he named Abu Sabrah and dropped out Hatib or Abu Hatib.
He also dropped out Ibn Mas'ud. On the other hand, although
'Urwah459 maintained that they were eleven men and four women,
he said Ibn Mas'ud was one of them but not Hatib.
Included in this first batch of emigrants were: Abu Salamah bin
'Abdul-Asad, his wife Umm Salamah bint Abu Umaiyah (she later
became a wife of the Prophet M, and has a long Hijrah-Hadith to her
credit), 'Uthman bin Maz'un, Mus'ab bin 'Umayr, 'Uthman bin
'Affan and his wife Ruqayyah, a daughter of the Prophet i|§.
The Prophet ii said about 'Uthman and Ruqayyah (may Allah
be pleased with them): ''They are the first family to migrate after
Ibrahim and Lut."460
This Hijrah is known as the first Hijrah to Abyssinia. Ibn Hisham461
has written that 'Uthman bin Maz'un was appointed their leader.
These people hadn't stayed there for long when news reached
them that the Makkans had embraced Islam. So they decided to
return to Makkah the same year in Shawwal.462 However, when
they got near Makkah they learnt that what they had heard was
only rumor, and that the fire of hatred had not yet died down. Some
of them returned to Abyssinia while a few opted to re-enter
Makkah, either concealing themselves thereafter, or living under the
protection of one of the Quraysh.4
457 Ibn Hisham (398-399) and As-Siyar wal-Maghazi, pp. 223-224, without a
chain, so it is weak.
458 See Sirat Dhahabi, pp. 184-185.
459 As-Siyar wal-Maghazi, p. 105, through a weak chain.

Some historians have conjectured that the reason for their
return was a rumour that a compromise solution had been worked
out between the Quraysh and the Muslims. Its main point was that
the Prophet
had allegedly praised their deities and acknowledged
their important position. It was said that the Prophet j|§ recited the
chapter An-Najm in the Holy Mosque. When he reached.

"Have you considered the Lat and 'Uzza and the third of the
three the Manat?"4:64
— at that point Satan interjected the following words in the ears of
the pagans, “These lofty swans, surely their intercession is a thing
coveted." It is alleged that the Prophet i|g prostrated himself, and
following him the Makkan pagans prostrated themselves. When this
story reached Abyssinia, the Muslims thought that the Quraysh had
embraced Islam.
Ibn Sa'd,465 Tabari466 and Bayhaqi46/ have reported this story
but none of the six doctrinal Hadith collections, nor Imam Ahmad,
nor other reliable books have entered them in their works. It is a
false report both narration-wise, as well as text-wise. Here are the
opinions of the scholars:

(i) The Chain of Narration

Ibn Kathir456 said, "Many commentators of the Qur'an have
mentioned this story, but all of them have the name of the
Companion-narrator at the top missing. I have not come across a

"As for the first source, it might be sufficient for you to know that
none of the six canonical collections have mentioned this story and
that no trustworthy narrator has narrated it through an unbroken
chain. There are many broken chains of narration that carry different
versions of the story, some with contradictory statements. It seems
to be popular with those commentators and historians who go after
every bizarre story. They piece together material both of dubious
nature as well as those of trustworthy origins. But none of the
commentators or the historians have been able to cite a good chain,
nor has anyone claimed to have heard it directly from a Companion.
Most of the chains are worthless ..."
Ibn Hajar470 said, after mentioning a few chains, "All of them
are untrustworthy narrators except Sa'eed bin Jubayr. They are
either untrustworthy or the chains are broken. However, the fact
that it is so well spread a story, indicates that it has a basis,
especially when it has one or two chains that are broken just after
the Prophet 0„ but are otherwise trustworthy that can be judged by
the criterion set by Bukhari and Muslim. One such is in Tabari
coming through Yunus bin Yazid, he through Ibn Shihab ... The
second one is also in Tabari coming through Mu'tamar bin
Sulayman, Hammad bin Salamah ..."
Dr. 'Abdul-Mu'ti Qala'ji471 has presented some new and logical
reasons to refute the swans fable.
Albani472 has in fact written a short book on this topic. He has
collected all the traditions speaking of this story and demonstrated
the weaknesses or spuriousness of everyone of them. He has also
demonstrated that there are some reports of the Disconnected
(Mursal) nature that have trustworthy chain of narrators: that is,
those reports that miss a Companion, with the originator directly
speaking on behalf of the Prophet 0Jf although he is not a
Companion, rather, a second-generation follower. He too agrees
with Ibn Hajar that when so many narrations are there on the
subject, although all of fhem weak, they have to have some basis.

The Prophet of Islam

Nonetheless, he differs with Ibn Hajar473 in his conclusions. Ibn
Hajar accords strength to the weak reports. He says, “When several
chains of transmission are available, and their originators are distantly
placed, then that is a sign that the story has a basis. I have pointed out
that there are three chains of transmission that, although Discon¬
nected (Mursal) at the end, are trustworthy. Those who accord value to
such Mursal narrations might accord them the value they think
suitable — in fact, even those who do not accord them any value, (may
do so in this case) because of one strengthening the other." In contrast,
Albani474 does not believe that several chains of narration strengthen
each other if they are all weak. He rejects them all because, according
to him, weak reports do not strengthen each other.
Dr. Muhammad Mustafa A'zami4'5 took a stand against Albani
over this issue. He wrote:
“Albani476 has quoted Ibn Taymiyyah on the question of
acceptance of Disconnected reports (Marasil, sing. Mursal). The sum
and substance of what Ibn Taymiyyah had to say is, 'If two
Disconnected reports come to us from two different directions such
that each narrator took the report from a narrator different from the
narrator of the other report, then this signifies the narration of a fact,
for, normally, one cannot suppose the occurrence of a mistake or an
intention to lie in a case of this sort.'
“Some scholars have censured Albani over his acceptance of
this principle. I might point out however that this principle is not
Albani's invention. Rather, he has taken it from Imam Shafi'i and
others who came after him (i.e., after Shafi'i) such as, Ibn
Taymiyyah, Nawawi, and others. Suyuti47' too has said, 'If a
Mursal has a strong chain of narration, and compares well with
another, either Mursal or Musnad (one reaching the Prophet
without a break), and the narrators are all different, then the report
is trustworthy.' Shafi'i478 has also written something similar except
473 Al-Fath (18/42).

474 See Nasibul-Manjaniq, p. 20 and what follows.

that he accepts Marasil of prominent second-generation Followers
(Tabi in) alone, on the condition that the narrators named in that
report are all trustworthy, and who did not say anything in
contradiction to the reported text. He also added the conditions that
(a) either a Companion should have something similar to say, (b) or
most scholars should have decreed its legality in substance.
However, if such conditions are not met, then the Mursal report is
not acceptable. And, there is no doubt about it that such conditions
are not found in the issue under consideration. Therefore, Ibn
Hajar's declaration of their trustworthiness, is an error from him.'"
Dr. Abu Shahbah479 has replied to Ibn Hajar's statement in AlFath and those of the scholars who have followed him in that
opinion such as Suyuti. Dr. Abu Shahbah wrote:
1. "The majority of Hadith scholars have not used Mursal reports
declaring them as belonging to the weak class, expressing the
concern that the one whose name is missing could have been a nonCompanion in which case either trustworthy or non-trustworthy.
(In contrast, the Companions were all trustworthy — Translator.) This
means, we cannot be sure that the missing narrator was not a liar.
We find Imam Muslim480 stating this. He wrote, 'A Mursal report is
neither acceptable to us (Hadith scholars), nor to others (non-Hadith
scholars).' Ibn Salah481 has said, 'What I have stated as the refusal by
the scholars to use a Mursal report, and the untrustworthiness of
such reports is what majority of Hadith scholars have adopted as a
principle. This can be observed from their works — although the
schools of Imam Malik and Abu Hanifah believe in relying on them
when necessary. As for Shafi'i, he accepts them on certain conditions
which he mentioned in his Ar-Risalah. 'Iraqi has mentioned this in
his The Two Thousand (Rules) in Verse, as have others.
2. Usage of Mursal reports is restricted to minor issues in Law,
where total freedom from the conjectural is not a necessary
requirement. But dependence on it in matters of faith and beliefs

is out of the question. In addition, one might be reminded that the
above story has not been reported by any of the six canonical works
nor by Imam Ahmad, in fact, not by any trustworthy Hadith
collector."

(ii) Common Sense

(a) Contradiction with the Qur'an
Dr. 'Azami482 writes in refutation of this story, "If we suppose
for a moment that its chains of narration are trustworthy, does it
mean the narration is true? Allah forbid that it be so.
"It cannot be overlooked that the report is one of those that
have been termed as Shadh. That is, a tradition that contradicts in its
meaning another Hadith whose narrator is more trustworthy, or
who transmits more number of Ahadith on that topic. Further, Shadh
Hadith is also of the untrustworthy variety. This is the ruling that
applies when it happens to be of the Ahad type (singletons, or, those
that originate from a single source). Further, if an Ahad report
contradicts the Qur'an and the consensus of the community of
scholars, in matters involving belief in Prophets, then such a
tradition is not considered a Shadh tradition. It is treated as an
outright fabrication.
"This is a rule that was formulated in the older times. Ibn
Jawzi483 has said, 'Every Hadith that you find completely opposes
reason and intellect, or contradicts a well-established principle, is for
sure a fabricated one. It should not be passed on down the line.'"
Ibn Abu Hatim Razi484 wrote, "Hadith trustworthiness will
depend on the narrators. Further, it has to have a text that is worthy
of consideration as a statement of the Prophet

bin Zubayr.

"Now, what reason, however weak, would agree that the
Messenger ^ who brought a message of such pure and
unadulterated Tazvhid should make a deal with the pagans by
prostrating himself to their goddesses, and then attribute those
words to Allah?
"Even if the chains of narration had been as obviously bright as
the sun, the story couldn't have been true. Why then should an
interpretation be attempted when its chains of narration are as weak
as they are?"
One of the Qur'anic texts that the story contradicts is as
follows:

"Verily, you (Satan) shall have no power over My slaves except
such of the rebellious ones who follow you."485
Iblis (Satan) himself acknowledged that he will have no power
over Allah's true slaves. It is reported in the Qur'an,

JlS
"He said, 'By Your might, I shall mislead everyone of them
except Your true slaves."'486
Indeed, Satan has no power at all over those who believe in
Allah and have trust in Him. The Qur'an said,
*

/

(Jsj \ZS\

"Surely, he has no power over those who believe in Him and in
Him they place their trust."487
Now, who from among the Messengers was truer in his faith
and had greater trust iiy Allah than Prophet Muhammad H?

485 Surat Al-Hijr: 42.
486 Surat Sad: 82-83.
487 Surat An-Nahl: 99.

The Prophet of Islam

224
(b) Contradictions in the Reports

What weakens the story further are the contradictions between
its various versions. One version says the incident took place after a
prayer. Another says it happened during a prayer. One version says
the Prophet -i§ spoke to himself by error, a fourth says Satan spoke
out by his tongue. A fifth says the Prophet m, said it in a state of
extreme fatigue. A sixth says Satan was able to snatch a short spell
of silence during which he recited it in Prophet's style and accent.

(c) Rejection of the Story on Language Grounds
Shaykh Abu Shahbah488 has brought to our notice Shaykh
Muhammad ' Abduh's opinion who discredits the story for language
reasons. For instance, the pagan deities have never been alluded to
as swans elsewhere in the Arabic literature: be it prose or in Verse.
Further, no one has stated that the word was used in that sense by
the common folk, except that Mu'jamul-Buldan has referred to it, but
through unknown narrators. The term Ghumuq, Ghirnuq, Ghumiq,
and Ghirniq are all used for black and white water birds. One of its
variant meanings is 'a handsome young man/ It has other uses too.
But, it is never used in the sense of deities or goddesses, in a good
quality speech that eloquent orators would approve of.
Another linguistic reason for rejecting the story is the variant
language style of the two: the Qur'anic Verses and the words of the
pagans that supposedly fell in between. The first set of Verses say.
4©

'.s."

"Have you considered the Lat and'Uzza? And Manat the third of
the three?"1189
This passage was supposed to have been followed by the 'swan
Verse', viz., "These lofty swans, surely their intercession is a thing

coveted.” Then the Qur'anic Verses that come after say.

"These are but names that you and your forefathers have given,
for which Allah has sent down no authority. They follow not but

to them a guidance from their Lord.”490
It can be easily seen that the 'swan Verses' do not fit in
contextually or linguistically. In fact, the statements are contra¬
dictory. Far from rhetoricians and literary masters, even an ordinary
Arabic-knowing person will declare the passage with the interpola.

tion as grotesque.

As for those other Verses that are quoted as explaining the
incident of the 'swan story', viz..

"And We did not send before you a Messenger nor a Prophet
then except that when Satan intended to cause confusion. Allah
abrogates what Satan throws in and confirms His Verses. And
Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise."492

what can be said in their explanation is that Bukhari's

492 Surat Al-Hajj: 52.

The Prophet of Islam

226

explanation coming from Ibn 'Abbas

does not fit into the context.

He explains the textual word tamanni as alluding to 'recitation and
reading.' This in fact has lent credence to the story giving birth to the
confusion about the connection with the incident. But, it must be
noted that in this present usage the word tamanni does not have a
modifier. It cannot be bound to recitation or recitation of 'the Book.'
The grammatical modifier required for this is missing.
The explanation of the above, as found in a report in Bukhari, is
as follows: The word (tamanni) may be explained as meaning, 'He
intentionally spoke hoping to win his people to Islam.' This
interpretation agrees with the meaning of tamanni proposed by
Ibn 'Abbas as in Ibn Humayd. This might be acceptable since
linguistic explanations cannot be disregarded. 'Urjun has said (2/
173), "Ibn Manzur has also cited in his Al-Lisan some other examples
from Hadith as well as common usage. Linguists tend to believe that
the word tamanni or umniyyah are used for intention, love, a wish to
get something, etc. When it is said, Tamanna AI-Kitdba,' it means 'he
read and wrote it.' This meaning comes from no less a person than
the linguist Jawhari who shows emphatically that when tamanni is
used unattached (to an article, or word) then it means 'to intend', 'to
love', and will never be used in the sense of 'recitation' without the
addition of the word 'book.'493

(d) The Time of Occurrence
What Dr. Shami494 had to point out about the period of
revelation also destroys the credibility of the story. He shows that
if the Verses of Surat Al-Hajj that deal with 'tamanni' are not of the
Madani period altogether,

then,

at least they were revealed

between Makkah and Madinah journey; whereas the reported
incident of the 'swan story' is of the Makkan period. Can such a
large period of time be imagined between the incident (of the
'swan story') and the Verses (of Surat Al-Hajj) that commented on
the incident?

491 See 'Urjun: Muhammad Rasulullah (2/75).
494 See Min Ma'inis-Sirah, p. 76, footnote (3).

(e) Reason of Pagan Prostration
What is definitely proven, as in Al-Bukhari,495 is that the Prophet
#£ recited Surat An-Najm among a mixed gathering of Muslims and
pagans. The ending passage of this chapter being what it is —a
hammer blow to the heart — when the Prophet #| recited them, his
voice began to tremble for the threat they hold. When he reached the
words.

early warnings. The approaching Day has come close by. There is
none besides Allah Wlto can make it appear. Are you then
surprised with this discourse. You laugh and do not cry? And
you are proudly sporting?"496
... at this point the awesomeness of the text melted the hatred of
the proud listeners. They lost control of themselves and involun¬
tarily fell into prostration along with the believers. Even a man like
Walid bin Mughirah —an aged person (who could not bend
down) —took a handful of dust and rubbed it on his forehead, in
lieu of prostration.
But when they turned back from the assembly and felt that the
awe inspiring threats had got the better of their prejudice, they
regretted and wished to find an excuse for what had issued of them
involuntarily. So they dug up the story that the Prophet m, had
spoken well of their deities and quoted the 'swan Verses' that they
fabricated.497

Second Emigration to Abyssinia
When some of those who had migrated to Abyssinia returned,
they discovered that the persecution of the Muslims had actually got
intensified. The Prophet s|| too was a helpless witness to what was
happening. So he allowed a second batch to emigrate. This time they
were over eighty men and nineteen women.498 Other figures have
been suggested.
Imam Ahmad499 has a report coming from Ibn Mas'ud

He

498 See Ibn Ishaq without a chain—Sirat Ibn Hishdm (1/408); Zadul Ma'ad (3/26).
499 Al-Musnad (6/185/H. 4400/Shakir). Shakir said: "Its chain is Hasan." Ibn
Kathir said in Al-Biddyah wan-Nihdyah (3/77): "It has a strong chain. That
report leads us to believe that Abu Musa was of those who migrated from
Makkah to Abyssinia, if the report had not been interpolated by one of the
narrators." He also said, "It is said that it is reported by Abu Ishaq
through a different chain: Abu Burdah through Abu Musa. It is preserved
by Abu Nu'aym in his Dala'il (1/252). It says at the beginning, "The
Messenger of Allah ordered us to accompany Ja'far bin Abu Talib in the
migration to Abyssinia..." At the end of the report he said, after
mentioning Najashi's good treatment of them: "And he ordered us to be
furnished with food and clothes..." Thereafter Ibn Kathir added (3/77):
"This is how Hafiz Bayhaqi recorded in his Dala'il (2/299-300) through
Abu 'Ali Hasan bin Salam Sawwaq, through 'Ubaydullah bin Musa."
Then he mentioned through his chain until the words, "And he ordered
us to furnish with food and clothes." Ibn Kathir said, "This has an
authentic chain." Which leads us to believe that Abu Musa was in Makkah
and that he left with Ja'far to the Abyssinian lands. But the correct
position is that it was through Yazid bin 'Abdullah bin Abu Burdah
through his grandfather Abu Burdah, and he through Abu Musa: that
they learnt of the Prophet's journey (to Madinah) while they were in
Yemen. So they left as immigrants some fifty of them in a ship that tossed
them to the Najashi in Abyssinia. There they met Ja'far bin Abu Talib and
his companions. Ja'far ordered him to stay with them, so they stayed put
with him until they went down to the Prophet
during the Khayber
campaign. He said, "Abu Musa was witness to what transpired between
Ja'far and Najashi and so reported about it." He said, "Maybe the narrator
fell into an error when he said, 'the Prophet
ordered us to go along
(with Ja'far).' Allah knows best."
Shakir commented on Ibn Kathir's arguments in words, "It is some good
reasoning." See the footnote of the Musnad (6/187 and the previous notes).

said, "The Prophet

229

sent us to Najashi. We were some eighty

men including figures such as Ja'far, 'Abdullah bin 'Arfatah,
'Uthman bin Maz'un and Abu Musa ..." He did not mention the
number of women. Ibn Sa'd500 on the other hand mentioned the
number of men as eighty-three and women as eighteen: eleven
Qurayshi and seven non-Qurayshi. Ibn Ishaq501 has thought (in his

As-Siyar wal-Maghazi) that they numbered more than eighty men.
He

mentioned

the

names

of ten

women.

However,

in his

biographical^02 work he mentioned that they were eighty-three
men and, if we are to include the new born (given birth by Raytah
bint Harith), then twenty women. Ibn Qaiyim503 stated that there
were nineteen women. It seems there was discrepancy in the
numbers because there were a few young girls that some counted,
but others did not.

What strengthens the report of the biographers and war
chroniclers is Imam Ahmad's narration mentioned earlier.

As for Abu Musa's return along with Ja'far, see Bukhari/Al-Fath (15/36/H.
3872) which we shall present when dealing with the Khayber campaign,
Allah willing.
As regards Ibn Hajar, he tried to reconcile between the different
narrations, to say that possibly he first migrated to Makkah, turned
Muslim, so the Prophet
sent him to Abyssinia along with others he
sent, so he first went to his ancestral lands which lay in front of Abyssinia
on the eastern side. When he learnt of the Prophet sg settling down in
Madinah, he again migrated, along with those of his tribe who had
become Muslims, but. the sea waves tossed their boat to Abyssinia (AlPath, 15/32/...). This reconciliation was accepted by some scholars,
including Salihi in his Si rat: Subulul-Huda war-Rashad (2/533), and Sa ud in
his thesis for his Masters degree entitled: Ahadithul-Hijrah (p. 50) and
'Awdah in the foreword to his PhD thesis: Also As-Siratun-Nabawiyyah fisSahihayn, wa-Inda Ibn Ishaq, p. 301. Bukhari and Muslim agree with Ibn
Ishaq on the point that his return was in the company of Ja'far while the
Prophet 5tg was in Khayber, as we shall speak of when dealing with
Khayber campaign.

Quraysh’s Efforts to get back the Emigrants
Ibn Ishaq504 has the following report coming from Umm
Salamah in connection with the emigration to Abyssinia: "When we
descended on Abyssinian lands, we found ourselves in the
neighborhood of a good neighbor, the Najashi. He left us in peace
over our religion and we worshipped Allah, in a manner that
nothing untoward happened to us, nor did we hear anything that
would displease us. When the Quraysh learnt of these conditions,
they consulted amongst themselves and decided that they should
send two of their prominent men to Najashi to speak to him about
us. They also decided that they should bring expensive Makkan
gifts to him. Of course, the most delightful of things for them was
leather. So they collected a lot of leather and did not leave anyone of
his high priests without intending a gift for him. They sent
'Abdullah bin Abu Rabi'ah505 and 'Amr bin 'As instructing them
in words, 'Speak to every priest before speaking to Najashi about
them. Then offer the gifts to Najashi and seek to get our men
expelled before he has time to speak to them.' Accordingly, they met
every one of his priests and presented gifts marked for him before
they spoke to Najashi. They said to the priests, 'A few of our foolish
young men have entered the kingdom. They have abandoned their
religion, but have not entered into your religion, adopting an
innovative religion that neither you nor we are familiar with../"

Hadith literature also tells us that the priests agreed with the

504 As-Siyar wal-Maghazi, p. 213 and the following pages. See also Ibn Hisham
(1/413 and the following pages). Its chain is Hasan. It has been discussed
earlier, and it happens to be the best of the reports on the topic.
"'"'Hadith of Ibn Mas'ud
in the Musnad (6/185) through a Hasan chain,
which has been discussed earlier, and that the one who sent him along
with 'Amr, is 'Umarah bin Walid. 'Urjun's preference in his book
Muhammad Rasulullah (2/24) is to reconcile the reports in the following
manner: Quraysh sent a mission after the Muslim emigrants to Abyssinia
while a second delegation comprised of 'Amr bin 'As and 'Abdullah bin
Abu Rabi'ah, the main representatives. They had a follower among them
who was 'Umarah bin Walid.
For fuller discussion see his book of above mention (2/21-24).

From Birth to Emigration

231

Quraysh delegation that they would advise Najashi to order
expulsion of the Muslims without speaking to them. But when
Najashi was advised that, he preferred he would rather speak to
them directly to hear what they had to say.
When they were brought to him, it was Ja'far bin Abu Talib
who stood up as their spokesman. He explained to Najashi the truth
of the religion that Muhammad m had brought and the stand that
his people had taken against it.
When Najashi asked them to recite something of what the
Messenger j|| had brought of revelation, Ja'far read out the opening
passages of Surat Maryam. Najashi cried so much that his beard
became wet, and the priests cried so much that the books they were
carrying got wet.
Then Najashi spoke to the two Quraysh ambassadors telling
them, "This and what Jesus Christ had brought are from the same
lamp. Go away. By God I shall never hand them over to you."506

506 Here a question might arise: Did Najashi and his priests knew the Arabic
language to the extent that they were excited when they listened to the
Qur'an?
Suhayli said in his book Ar-Rawdul-Unuf (2/93) commenting on the Hadith
of 'Aishah
regarding Najashi gaining power over Abyssinia: "He
mentioned the Hadith of 'Aishah about Najashi when Allah reinstated him
as a king over Abyssinia, and that his people happened to have sold him
to an Arab trader. Then, when conditions became confused in Abyssinia
his people took him back from his master, and restored him.." Apparently,
the report lends us to believe that they took him from his master before he
could bring him to his lands. Another Hadith makes it clear that his master
was an Arab who took and kept him away a very long time. This is what
he means when he says, 'when the conditions became confused in
Abyssinia, and the affair became hard upon them ...' to the end. This
demonstrates his long absence from them ... It is reported that when the
report of Badr reached Najashi, he informed those of the Muslims who
were with him. He sent for them. When they came to him, they found him
wearing a ... until the words, 'I am to learn that he and his foes met in a
valley called Badr, a place full of Arak trees wherein I used to tend sheep
for my master. He was of Banu Damrah. Allah has defeated his enemies
and has helped His religion.' This report proves his long stay in the Arab
lands. And, from here, Allah knows best, he learnt the Arabic language
and so understood the Surat Maryam when recited to him.

The Prophet of Islam

232

While they were leaving, 'Amr told 'Abdullah, "By God.
Tomorrow I shall come up with something that will destroy their
peace and comfort."
The next day 'Amr bin 'As presented himself to Najashi once
again and told him, "These people say something most intolerable
about Jesus Christ." So Najashi sent for them. When they came in,
he asked them about what they thought of Jesus Christ. Ja'far
replied, "We say no more than what our Prophet has told us about
him that he was Allah's slave. His Messenger, His Spirit and His
Word that He blew into Virgin Mary."

To the above I would like to add that if we admit his stay for a long
while in Hijaz, and know of the fact of trade relations between Abyssinia
and the possibility of people of the Abyssinian lands learning the Arabic
language because of its importance for commercial reasons. It also used to
happen to the Muslims to whom the envoys of the Prophet
used to
speak to them in their tongues. Also, if we realize that Abu Nairuz, the
freed slave of 'Ali bin Abu Talib was a son of the Najashi himself and that
'Ali found him with a trader. He purchased him from him and then
released him in return of what his father had done to the Muslims. (See
As-Siyar wal-Maghazi of Ibn Ishaq, p. 220), through a Hasan chain. This is
according to one report. According to another, some people of Abyssinia
arrived at Makkah and stayed with Abu Nairuz for a month, suggesting
that he return so that they could make him the ruler of the land, but he
refused. (The same source as above). If we have all these facts then it does
not remain strange for us that Najashi and his courtiers knew how to
speak Arabic. Add to it the fact of ourselves being witness to the situation
in non-Arab world. You will find some Muslims memorizing the Qur'an
and deal with without being able to understand its meaning. This of
course is one of the miracles of the Qur'an. (Surely, We have made the
Qur'an easy, so, is there someone to take admonition?) It has also been
observed of non-Muslims dealing with the Qur'an without knowing the
Arabic language. According to a report of Ibn Ishaq coming from 'Urwah:
the one who used to speak to Najashi was 'Uthman bin 'Affan. See AsSiyar wal-Maghazi, pp. 218-219. However more popularly known is that it
was Ja'far who used to speak. See Ibn Kathir's Al-Bidayah (3/84), which is
what Ibn Ishaq has asserted, refuting 'Urwah. He said, "This is not true.
And the reports in this regard, it was Ja'far bin Abu Talib who used to
speak." See Ibn Ishaq's As-Siyar wal-Maghazi, p. 218. The reports in this
regard require some attention which we put off for the future, Allah
willing.

At that Najashi picked up a piece of straw from the ground and
said to Ja'far, "Jesus was no more than what you said about him
than this straw." He showed no concern for what his priests had to
say and granted the Muslims a peaceful stay in his lands. He also
returned the gifts the Quraysh had sent.507
The Quraysh felt humiliated by the outcome and did not find
anyone before them on whom they could expend their anger except
that they got tougher with those Muslims who were within their
range of action. As for Islam,, it had earned Najashi and Amr bin As
to its side.508
The Muslims remained there for a period that Allah (#§) had
willed for them. Those who wished, returned after the Muslim
emigration to Madinah and before the battle of Badr. Those who
returned at that time were thirty-three men and eight women.
The rest of them returned with Ja'far only in the seventh year after

Hijrah510 when the Prophet #| had overcome the Khayber problem.

The movement of some people to Abyssinia legalizes Hijrah
which is to move from a land of the disbelievers - where
worshipping Allah is made impossible - to another land where
He can be worshipped without fear. We will have more to say
on this topic when we deal with the Prophet's own Hijrah.

Sacrifice of one's wealth, homeland, and life are the foundation
stones on which this religion rests. If religion is lost, then
wealth, homeland and one's life are reduced to insignificance.
Indeed, with religion lost, they are also likely to fall into

oblivion. In contrast, if religion is established and strengthened
by society, and faith is well entrenched in the hearts, then the
loss of wealth and homeland are likely to be regained in quality
and quantity better than that was lost —since they will be then
armed with honor, strength and wisdom. Hijrah is a kind of
hardship borne in the cause of religion by way of sacrifice of
wealth and homeland to signify an exchange of hardship
greater than the hardship suffered, in the hope of a later victory.

It is allowable for Muslims to accept a shelter offered by nonMuslims, if need be, whether such shelter is provided by the
People of the Book such as the Christian King Najashi who later
became a Muslim, or pagans such as those under whose
protection some Muslims re-entered Makkah, or like Abu Talib
who gave protection to the Prophet i§, or Mut'im bin 'Adi who
accorded him protection when he was returning from Ta'if.511

Najashi’s Islam
In one of his narrations, Ibn Ishaq512 has reported that after
Najashi s death, the people could see a light emanating from his
grave. This leads us to believe that he had embraced the faith of
Islam.
Another report says that his people revolted against him
because he had become a Muslim and that before he battled against
them, he got a ship prepared for the Muslims to be taken out if he
were to be defeated. He is also said to have written a letter that
spoke of his Islam. That reached the Prophet ffc who sought his
forgiveness from Allah when he died.513

Hadith of Umm Salamah. Bukhari and Muslim reported that the Messenger
mourned the death of Najashi and said to the Companions: "Seek
Allah's forgiveness for your brother." Al-Fath (6/242/H. 1327). This Hadith
shows that it was Najashi. See also Muslim (2/657/H. 951).

From Birth to Emigration

235

These reports of Ibn Ishaq are in line with the reports in the

Sahihayn that speak of Najashi's Islam. Bukhari514 and Muslim515
have preserved the report that the Prophet j|| mourned the day he
died. That was the 9th year after Hijrah. He also offered prayers for
him with the Muslims behind him. The two516 sources517 have also
said that the Prophet jjjg said, "Today a pious Abyssinian Muslim
has died, so let's pray for him."
Muslim's518 report has it that the Prophet jgg said, "Your brother
has died, so rise up and pray for him." This report leaves little doubt
that he died a Muslim.
Further, the Najashi who died a Muslim is not the Najashi
whom the Prophet

|g invited to Islam when he wrote to him along

with the rest of the kings, rulers and monarchs of the surrounding
territories. One of Muslim's519 reports can be used to substantiate
this. Due to the fact that the reports do not specifically speak of two
Najashis, Shaykh Arna'ut520 is inclined to believe that the Najashi
over whom the Prophet $$. prayed, is the Najashi to whom he had
sent his letter of invitation.

Islam of Hamzah and ‘Umar
(a) Hamzah’s Islam
The entry of some of the important men of Quraysh into Islam
did not prevent the pagans from persecuting the Muslims. In that

it was Najashi. The last two narratives name him as Ashamah.

climate loaded with hatred, Allah willed that Abu Jahl's hatred of
the Prophet

should become the cause of Hamzah's entry into

Islam, who, although an uncle of the Prophet

|g, was till then a

declared opponent of Islam. Ibn Ishaq521 and Ibn Sa'd522 have both
reported that a slave-girl of 'Abdullah bin Jad'an informed Hamzah
of Abu Jahl's ill-treatment of the Prophet jig bordering to insult.
Without a moment's hesitation Hamzah went up to Abu Jahl while
he sat among some of the Qurayshi men and hit him on the head
with his bow, injuring him badly. Then, in his fury he yelled, "Do
you dare insult him while I am on his religion?" That outburst led
Hamzah to seriously consider Islam.
The Makkans were subject to various tendencies. On the one
hand their obstinacy prevented their entry into Islam. But, whenever
a new event touched their hearts and souls, the good tendencies
threatened to take over and drive off the evil ones. In connection
with Hamzah, the following report in Ibn Ishaq (in his As-Siyar wal-

Maghazi, p. 172) speaks of the two forces of good and evil in
struggle. The report tells us: "When Hamzah returned home,

Shay tan (Satan) came to him and chided him, 'Look! You are a
Quraysh chieftain. Will you abandon the religion of your forefathers
and follow that of this upstart? Surely, death is better for you than
that.' That brought him back feelings of regret. Confused, he finally
said, 'O Lord. If this (new religion) be true, open my heart to it. If
not, find a way out for me.' He spent the night so disturbed as never
before because of Satan's prompting and planting of doubts. In the
morning he went up to the Prophet #§ and said, 'My dear nephew. I
have fallen in a situation out of which I don't know the way out. I

Hakim in Al-Mustadrak (3/193) through Ibn Ishaq. Both he and Dhahabi
did not commit themselves to any opinion. However, since its chain is
also Munqati', the reports are all weak.
522 At-Tabaqdt (3/9) through Waqidi who is abandoned in Haditli. He did not
mention who reported the incident of Abu Jahl insulting the Prophet
and
added that others who insulted the Prophet
were 'Adi bin Hamra' and
Ibn Asda'. Haythami mentioned it in the Majma' (9/267) from a narration of
Tabarani but both transmissions being of Mursal chain. However, the
transmitters of one of them are Sahih, while of the other trustworthy.

am not able to decide if this thing (that you present) is the truth or, is
it a huge fallacy? So, speak out to me/ The Prophet

spoke to him

in detail, giving him good tidings, warning him of dire con¬
sequences of rejection, and things of that sort. Allah (f§) inspired
faith into Hamzah's heart and so he admitted, T believe you are
right. My testimony comes from my heart. So go ahead and work
for your cause openly. By God, I will not prefer to have all the riches
under the sky in exchange of this new religion.' Thus, Hamzah
proved to be one of those who strengthened the Islamic rank.
When Hamzah embraced Islam, the Quraysh realized that the
Prophet ^ stood stronger and that Hamzah was henceforth going to
protect him.523 That led them to withhold some of what persecu¬
tions they were delivering to the Prophet #|.
Hamzah's Islam, declared in the house of Arqam, was an event
of the sixth year after revelation.524

(b) ‘Umar’s Islam
'Umar

too was one of the most dedicated enemies of Islam.

He was known for his hot temper and muscle power. The Muslims
had quite often experienced persecutions and torments at his hands.
Sa'eed bin Zayd, his brother-in-law said, "By Allah, I have been
through those days when 'Umar would tie me up and his sister
because of Islam, before he embraced it himself."525 According to
another version, "Only if you had seen me tied up because of my
Islam, me and his sister, before his own declaration of Islam.
Ibn Ishaq527 has reported that Umm 'Abdullah Layla, the wife

524 Ibn Sa'd: At-Tabaqdt (3/9) from Waqidi's narration; thus it is very weak.
525 This was reported by Ahmad in Facia ilus-Sahabah (1/278), and the verifier
judged it as Sound ([Sahib).
526 Reported by Al-Bukhdri/Al-Fath (15/25/H. 3867), As-Siyar wal-Maghdzi, p. 181.
527 See As-Siyar wal-Maghdzi, p. 181, and Ibn Hishdm (1/423) through a Hasan
chain. Ahmad reported it in the Fadd'ilus-Sahabah (1/279) through I n
Ishaq but did not mentioned the authority above Ibn Ishaq.

238

The Prophet of Islam

of 'Amir bin Rabi'ah said, while 'Amir was out for something, "By
Allah we were preparing to move out to Abyssinia — and my
husband was out —when 'Umar entered on me. He was still a
pagan. We used to experience torture at his hands. He stood there
before me and asked, 'Are you going to go away also, O Umm
'Abdullah?' She replied, 'Yes we will. You have inflicted pain upon
us. Maybe Allah will find for us a way out of this.'" She continued,
"If you had seen 'Umar then: his softening and his grief over us..."
(Later, 'Amir, her husband) asked, "Do you covet his Islam?" She
replied, "Yes." He said, "He will not embrace Islam even if
Khattab's donkey became a Muslim." 'Amir said this from his
experience of 'Umar's hardness of heart and his inflexible opposition
to the Muslims.
This report leads us to believe that 'Umar's natural disposition
to the good was struggling with the pagan ideas that overshadowed
him, until a moment came when he was able to cast off the evil
overshadowing his good nature. He entered into Islam and his
stubbornness for pagandom turned into his firmness in Islam.
When Allah

(ig) opened his heart for Islam, he inquired, "Who

is the fastest around here in conveying news?" The people said,
"Jamil bin Ma'mar Jumahi." So 'Umar went up to him and informed
him of his conversion to Islam. Jamil rushed up to the Ka'bah and
shouted among the people, "Lo. 'Umar has become a Sabian," with
'Umar right behind him saying, "You have lied. I have become a
Muslim." That led him into a physical tussle with the Quraysh until
'As bin Wa'il Sahmi rescued him.528

~s Ahmad: Fadd'ilus-Sahdbah (1/281-282), and the verifier said that the chain
is Hasan. Another brief narration in Ahmad under Fada'ilus-Sahdbah (1/
282-283) mentions that As bin Wa'il gave protection to 'Umar when some
people gathered to attack him. The redactor ruled the report as Hasan.
Bukhari reported a Hadith of lbn 'Umar 4* that says that the people
crowded at his house when he announced his Islam and that 'As bin Wail
gave him protection, see Al-Fath (15/21/H. 3865). According to another
narration the people were on their way to attack him, after learning of his
Islam but As saved him, Al-Fath (15/20). This Hadith is also reported by
lbn Ishaq through a Hasan chain - lbn Hisham (1/428-429), as it is also in
As-Siyar wal-Maghazi, p. 184.

From Birth to Emigration

239

As for the popular story narrated in connection with his
acceptance of Islam, it has not come to us through a sound chain of
narrators. It says that he was on his way to murder the Prophet #§.
Someone met him on the way and expressed his surprise that 'Umar
wasn't aware of the Islam of his own sister and brother-in-law.
When he learnt that, he was angry and repaired to the house of his
sister and brother-in-law. He found Khabbab with them. He beat his
brother-in-law and even his sister until blood was flowing on her
face. That cooled him a bit'. He had found them reciting the Qur'an.
Those were Verses of Surat Ta-Ha. He asked it to be recited to him.
But they insisted that he first take a bath before he could touch it. He
did that. The Qur'an was read to him and he went to the Prophet jgg
to inform him of his Islam. It also says that he rejected the protection
of his uncle 'Asi so that he might face what the weaker Muslims
were facing until Allah gave power to Islam. Yet, and although
some parts of this story have come through somewhat reliable
narrators, the story, as detailed out here, hasn't got a strong chain,
the kind that the Hadith doctors would accept. Wasiullah,529
Hammam, Abu Su'ailik530 and others have declared it weak.
In truth, 'Umar's Islam was an answer to the Prophet's
supplication. He used to say in his supplications,

O Allah.

Strengthen Islam with the Islam of either of the two that are dearer
to You." He had Abu Jahl and 'Umar bin Khattab531 in his mind.

529 See his footnotes under Fadailus-Sahabah by Ahmad bin Hanbal (1/285-286).
530See their footnotes in Sirat Ibn Hishdm (1/425), there the story was
reported by Ibn Ishaq without a chain. See also Dhahabi s Sirat, p. 179
where he declared its status as weak. Ibn Sa'd also reported it by another
route than that of Ibn Ishaq, yet by a weak chain, as mentioned by
Haythami in the Majma' (9/63-65) and Abu Nu'aym in Ad-Dalail (1/241)
and the latter with a very weak chain for it consists of Ishaq bin 'Abdullah
Abu Farwah, who was abandoned as a narrator. However, the fact that
the biographers quoted this story tells us that it has a historical origin and
hence there is no harm in using it as a historical piece of data.
531 Reported by Ahmad in his Musnad (2/95) through a Hasan chain, see AIFathur-Rabbani (20/230) and 'Abd bin Humayd in his Muntakhab Musnad,
p 245, H. 759; and At-Tirmidhi through a reliable chain (3/204) about
which Albani said: “Sahih" Also Bayhaqi in the Dalail (2/216), as also
Hakim in his Al-Mustadrak (3/83) tracing it to 'Aishah >*, who declared it

240

So Allah strengthened Islam through 'Umar bin Khattab 4e. We
have Bukhari's532 report coming from Ibn Mas'ud

He said, "We

continued to gather strength from the day 'Umar embraced Islam."
Many other reports have come down to us speaking of Islam
gaining strength because of him, pointing to the important role he
played in the history of Islam. One report is in Ibn Ishaq1*33
originating with 'Umar himself. It says, "When I embraced Islam, I
scanned around for the Makkan who was the severest in his hatred
of the Prophet j|g. I decided it was Abu Jahl. So I proceeded to his
house and knocked at his door. He came out and said, 'Welcome to
you. What brings you here?' I said, 'I have come to tell you that I
have become a believer in Allah and his Messenger and in the
Message that he has brought/ Abu Jahl shut the door powerfully in
my face muttering, 'May Allah destroy you and destroy the news
that you have brought.'"
Ibn Mas'ud

said,

"'Umar's

Islam was

a

triumph,

his

migration a victory, and his caliphate a mercy. We couldn't perform
prayers near the Ka'bah until 'Umar's Islam. When he embraced
Islam, he fought the Quraysh until he prayed in front of the Ka'bah
and we prayed along with him."534
Suhayb the Roman said, "Islam emerged stronger with 'Umar's

reliable with Dhahabi agreeing with him. It also happens to be a Hadith of
Ibn 'Abbas i$*> with the words, "O Allah, strengthen Islam with 'Umar."
Hakim said, "This is a reliable report so far as its chain is concerned,
although the Shaykhayn did not record it. Dhahabi also mentioned it in his
Sirat, p. 172. Yunus bin Bukair narrated it through a chain other than that
of Ibn Ishaq, p. 185. But its transmission chain is weak because of the
presence of Nadr Abu 'Umar who is identified as Ibn 'Abdur-Rahman
Khazzaz Kufi. To sum up, the report is Sound (Sahih).
532Al-Fath (14/186, H. 3684). He embraced Islam in the sixth or the seventh
year from the day of the Prophet's call. This is stated by Ibn Hajar during
his commentary on this report. See At-Tabaqdt of Ibn Sa'd (3/269-270)
where this Hadith is mentioned and the date when 'Umar embraced Islam.
333 Ibn Hisham (1/430) through a chain in which there is an unknown person.
The rest of the narrators are trustworthy, yet the report is weak.
534 Ibn Hisham (1/422) offering us a narration of Ibn Ishaq with a weak chain;
as well as Ibn Sad (3/270), with a weak chain also.

declaration of faith. He began to invite others to it openly. We began
to sit in a circle near the Ka'abah, circumambulate it, took revenge
on him who wronged us, returning to him with what he inflicted us
with."535
Ibn 'Abbas is reported to have said that when 'Umar embraced
Islam the pagans remarked, "Now the Muslims will wreak
vengeance on us."536
It is also reported that the Prophet $§; named him Al-Faruq,537
meaning one who drew a line between truth and falsehood.
Although these reports do not come through strong chains,
there is no harm in narrations of this sort since they do not have a
bearing on legal matters nor do they touch upon faith and beliefs.
That said, there is no second opinion that 'Umar's Islam did
strengthen Islam. This is deduced from the Prophet's well preserved
words, "O Allah, strengthen Islam with the Islam of either of the
two dearer to You: Abu Jahl or 'Umar bin Khattab."

Lessons
1.

Men of power and influence from among the disbelievers can
prove to be a source of strength to the Islamic movement. This is
the reason for the Prophet #| to covet the Islam of Abu Jahl or
'Umar. This point is further illustrated by another report, which
said, "Those who were the best of the people before Islam would
be the best of them in Islam, provided they gain understanding538

535 ibn Sa'd (3/269). One of the narrations of Waqidi, so it is very weak.
536 Ahmad bin Hanbal: Fadailus-Sahabah (1/248) through a weak chain.
537 Dhahabi said in his Sirat, p. 179: (It is narrated by Ibn 'Abbas 4 through
a weak chain.) He said, "I asked 'Umar, for what reason were you named
Al-Faruq?' In reply he narrated the story of how he was led to Islam, how
he beat his sister and he? husband and finally his going to the Prophet m
at Darul-Arqam. At the end of the report he said: 'So the Messenger of
Allah called me Al-Fdruq.'" Ibn Sa'd reported through weak chains that
the Prophet *81 named him Al-Faruq. See Ibn Jawzi, the biography of
'Umar bin Khattab, p. 23, 30-31.
538 Al-Bukhdri/Al-Fath (13/161/H. 3374).

(of the religion of Islam)." Therefore, the callers to Islam should
not neglect to pay attention to important, influential personalities
of the disbelieving societies. One advantage is that the acceptance
of Islam by such people removes a lot of doubt and hesitation on
the part of their followers. This has always been the case. The
Qur'an said,

"The Day when their faces will be turned about in the Fire. They
will say, 'Only that we had obeyed Allah and obeyed the Prophet.'
And they will say, 'O Lord. We obeyed our chiefs and important
men bu t they took us off the straight road. O Lord. Inflict upon them
double the punishment and curse them greatly. '"539
However, invitation should not be confined to the leaders and
people of influence. In fact, Muslim leadership — those mis¬
guided off the Islamic course in the affairs of this life —needs
also to be addressed.
2.

The Prophet's gesture of rising up to receive 'Umar bin Khattab

4k> when he presented himself to him at Arqam's house, holding
him by the end-piece of his shirt540 and pulling him toward
himself, exposing himself to the risk that 'Umar could instead
attack him (since his Islam was not yet known), as reported by
Ibn Ishaq and others is a good example of the Prophet's courage
at a difficult time. We will be encountering this on other
occasions also, such as his attitudes at Uhud and Hunayn.

539 Surat Al-Ahzab: 66-68.
540 The allusion here is to the popular story of how 'Umar 4* embraced
Islam. A narration of Ibn Ishaq and Ibn Sa'd as mentioned earlier where
we also stated that the report is weak, and not acceptable as a Hadith,
and that its acceptance by the biographers tells us that the story has an
origin.

General Boycott
When the Quraysh saw that the number of those entering into
Islam was on the rise, and that the methods adopted by them
towards combating it had failed, especially after the Islam of
Hamzah and 'Umar 4b, they had to reconsider their methods. They
decided therefore to embark on another strategy which was no less
harder to bear than the previous one: it was to boycott the Prophet's
entire tribe.541
Ibn Ishaq,542 Musa bin 'Uqbah,543 'Urwah bin Zubayr,544 Ibn
Sa'd545 and others of the biographers have reported that when the
Quraysh saw that the Companions of the Prophet s|| had found an
abode of peace (in Abyssinia), that 'Umar and Hamzah had gone
into the fold of Islam and that Islam had now begun to spread in the
tribes,

they

agreed

together that

they'd

get the Prophet ^

assassinated. When this news reached Abu Talib, he got Banu
Hashim and Banu Muttalib assembled together. During the meet¬
ing, they decided that they would keep the Prophet § in a Shi'b
(narrow valley) within Makkah preventing any attempt on his life.
This was their response to the threat by the Quraysh although many
of them were not Muslims. When the Quraysh noticed that, they
called for an assembly of their own, and entered into an agreement
regarding Banu Hashim and Banu Muttalib to the effect that they
will not enter into any (commercial) deal with them nor intermarry
with them until they had willingly handed over the Prophet ^ to

used to fight Islam —method number fourteen.

them. They hung the boycott agreement inside the Ka'bah. It was
Mansur bin Tkrimah who wrote it. The Prophet

supplicated

against him and a few of Mansur's fingers became stiff with
paralysis. Some have said that it was Nadr bin Harith who wrote it.
Others say it was Talhah bin Abu Talhah.546 However, both Banu
Hashim and Banu Muttalib entirely stood by Abu Talib —except
Abu Lahab. He sided with the Quraysh. It is said that the boycott
started in Muharram of the seventh year after the Prophet

was

commissioned. It lasted from two to three years. Musa bin 'Uqbah34'
is positive that it was three years. A time came when they were
really hard pressed since nothing could reach them of the food
grains except what was supplied to them stealthily. The Quraysh
even punished those of their relatives about whom they learnt that
they had secretly passed on gifts to them. It went on until some of
the important opponents of Islam from the Quraysh themselves
could no more reconcile themselves with the severity the boycott
entailed. They were Hisham bin 'Amr bin Harith, Zuhayr bin
Umaiyah, Mut'im bin 'Adi, Zam'ah bin Aswad and Abu Bakhari bin
Hisham bin Harith. They were all related to the Banu Hashim and
Banu Muttalib.

Ibn Hisham's548 report says that when they looked into the

46Suhayli said in Ar-Rawd (2/127): "The Quraysh genealogists say that he is
is identified as Baghid bin 'Amir bin Hashim bin 'Abdud-Dar." A second
opinion is that: "He is Mansur bin 'Abd Shurahbil bin Hisham of Banu
'Abdud-Dar, which is contrary to what Ibn Ishaq said. Zubayr did not
mention any other opinion in the Sahifah except for these two opinions,
while we know that the Zubayri's are experts in the genealogical details of
their people. Ibn Qaiyim goes with Suhayli to say that the person alluded
here was Baghid bin 'Amir—Zadul-Ma'ad (3/30).

and 'Urwah551 have mentioned the opposite: the termites had eaten
off Allah's Name at every point mentioned. What remained in it was
a reminder of their oppression and wrongdoing. The substance of
both reports is the same: Allah's Name could not be associated with
oppression and wrongdoing.
Suhayli wrote552 - which is also confirmed by Sahih553 reports that the Banu Hashim were so hard hit that they were forced to
eating tree554 and shrub leaves until some of them stooled faeces like
sheep. Sa d bin Abu Waqqas was one of them. He is reported to
have said, “Once I felt extremely hungry. One night I stepped on to
something soft. I put it in my mouth. And, till today I don't know
what it was.'' Yunus555 has a report which narrates him, “I was one
of those caught up with the Prophet gg (during the boycott). One
night I went out to pass urine. I felt it was falling on something hard.
It was a camel's skin. I washed it, burnt it, ground it between two
stones, swallowed the powder and drank some water over it. It gave
me strength for three days."
Whenever a caravan berthed outside Makkah and one of them
went out to purchase some food Abu Lahab would warn the seller,
“O men of trade. Inflate the prices for Muhammad's men so that

552 Ar-Rawdul-Unuf (2/127-128).
5531 could not locate this Hadith, however in another incident, Bukhari
reported a Hadith of Sa'd which says, “We use to go out in military
campaigns in the company of the Prophet #|, with no food for us except
leaves of trees to the extent that one of us would excrete in the like of
camels or goats." Al-Bukhari/Al-Fath (14/231/H. 3728). Also see the report
traced out under Fadailus-Sahdbah by Ibn Hanbal (2/750), present in the
footnotes of redactor.

However, he dropped the name of one of the transmitters. We have
mentioned the text. It seems possible that Suhayli took the report from
other than this text. So, one might compare.

they cannot afford to buy. You know me as a responsible person. I
promise you that you will not be the losers." So, with the prices
blown up, they would return empty-handed to their children crying
aloud from hunger. The traders would then go to Abu Lahab. He
would compensate them. The boycott put the believers under great
suffering until some of them died of it as a report of Ibn 'Abbas ^
tells us.556
Nonetheless, despite the boycott and suffering, the Prophet 3^2
did not give up preaching. Every (pilgrimage) season he would set
out meeting those who came into Makkah offering them Islam. Nor
did he neglect the townsmen among whom he continued to
preach.557
Ultimately, when the compact writing was worn out, the
Muslims came out of the boycott resuming normal life.558
Sahih books have not mentioned the boycott in detail.
Bukhari554 has mentioned it indirectly and in brief. Abu Hurayrah
has reported that when the Prophet ^ was on his way to Hunayn
he said, "By Allah's Will, tomorrow we shall pitch our camp at
Khayf560 where the Banu Kinanah swore over disbelief (i.e.,
boycott)." He has another narration561 of Abu Hurayrah that when
they intended for Makkah he said, "By Allah's Will tomorrow we
shall pitch our camp at Khayf where the Banu Kinanah swore over
disbelief."

556This was mentioned by Abu Nu'aym in his Dalai1 (1/279) with an
Interrupted (Munqati') chain, and so a weak report.
557 Ibn Hisham (1/434) without a chain. So it is weak.

There are other opinions too. Most famous Akhyaf are the Khayf of Mina
and its mosque the Khayf Mosque. They said that indeed is the Khayf of
Banu Kinanah.. See Muhammad, Muhammad Hasan Shirab, Al-Ma'alimulAthiratu fis-Sunnati was-Sirati, entry "Khayf, p. 110.
561 Al-Fath (7/242, H. 1589).

247

A third report coming through Awza'i and Zuhri says, "Tomor¬
row, the day of sacrifice, we shall be pitching our camp at Khayf of the
Bunu Kinanah who swore over disbelief." He was referring to
Muhassab. Quraysh and Kinanah had entered into a compact that
they would not intermarry with Banu Hashim and Banu Muttalib nor
trade with them until they handed over the Prophet 0, to them 562
Ibn Hajar563 thinks there is no contradiction between the two
reports. He could have said those words while entering Makkah
when it fell, and on another occasion when he was starting out for
Hunayn. As regards the third report, it appears that he said those
words at the time of his farewell Hajj, which means Awza'i's report
is of the time when the Prophet ^ was coming down from Mina,
heading towards Makkah to perform his farewell Tawdf.
Muslim"64 has a report which says that Usamah bin Zayd asked
the Prophet #£ during the Farewell pilgrimage when they were
nearing Makkah, "O Messenger of Allah, where shall we pitch our
camp?" He answered, "Has 'Aqil left us a place to alight?"
According to another report, "Has 'Aqil left for us a vacant quarter
or a house?" This means he did not go back to his ancestral home.
This does not contradict Bukhari's report that he camped in the Abu
Talib valley (without alighting in his own house).

Lessons
In addition to the points mentioned in the previous chapter, the
following might be added:
k

1.

At no time or place the world is totally devoid of good and
decent people. Those working for Islam ought to identify them
in order to make use of them in times of trouble.

2.

Allah's enemies will, through the ages, resort to use the economic
weapon in order to turn the believers back from their course. It is a

562 Al-Fath (7/242/H. 1590).
563 Al-Fath (15/39).
564 Sahih Muslim (2/984/H. 1351).

weapon that has the consent of the hypocrites and disbelievers
alike. Had the Muslims of that time been in their employment,
surely their employers would have terminated their services as
war strategy. The excommunication of Muslims suited the
situation prevalent at that time. The Islamic workers must
understand it and know how it can be extended and given new
forms at other times.
3.

There is consolation in what the Prophet
was struck with: he
is an example for the Muslims working in the path of Islam and
who can be struck with similar trials and tribulations.

4.

Pagandom, either old nor new, will never be without those noble
qualities that can be relied on and made use of by the Muslims.
Banu Hashim for instance offered a great sacrifice holding on to
the pagan custom of standing by the blood relations and
defending them during the boycott. In our own times, we find
the same phenomenon expressed in modem slogans, such as
'human rights/ 'political compulsions' or 'freedom of thought';
there is no harm in exploiting such principles as Muslims of the
earliest times did who profited from Banu Hashim's backing
when besieged in the Abu Talib valley.

Abu Talibs Death
Abu Talib died in the tenth year after the commissioning of the
Prophet
and just a few days after leaving the Abu Talib valley.565
It is said that he died in Ramadan three days566 before the death of
Khadijah
— three years before Hijrah.56' Another report says that
there was a time gap of a month and five days between his and
Khadijah's death.568

566 Sirat of Dhahabi, p. 237.
567 Ibn Sa'd (8/18) through Waqidi; Sirat Ibn Hisham (2/66) without a chain.
He did not mention the month and said it was three years prior to the
Hijrah. But the transmissions are weak.
568 Ibn Sa'd (1/211) through Waqidi who was abandoned.

Sahih reports confirm that he died a disbeliever despite having
defended the Prophet £g| all his life. Bukhari569 and Muslim570 have
reported on the authority of Ibn Musaiyab that the Prophet it
entered upon Abu Talib when he was about to breathe his last. He
found Abu Jahl and 'Abdullah bin Umaiyah bin Mughirah there
present. He told him, "My uncle. Say the words, 'There is no God
except Allah,' so that I can bear witness before Allah." Abu Jahl and
'Abdullah bin Umaiyah said, "O Abu Talib. Will you abandon
'Abdul-Muttalib's religion?" The Prophet i§| kept repeating his
words and they theirs until the last thing Abu Talib said was that he
was on the religion of 'Abdul-Muttalib, refusing to say 'There is no
God except Allah.' The Prophet ^ remarked, "By Allah, I shall keep
seeking forgiveness for you until I am forbidden." So Allah revealed.

"It was not for the Prophet and the believers to seek forgiveness

that the Prophet #| said to his uncle, "Say 'There is no God except
Allah,' so that I can bear witness to your faith." He said, "If not for
the fear of the Quraysh taunting me by saying that he didn't say that
except from fear of the death, I would have set your eyes cool (by
saying it)." Allah revealed.

The Prophet of Islam

c-Lii*}

(j*4 c£-C"

"You will not be able to guide those you love. Rather, Allah
guides whom He wills."
As regards those narrations that affirm that Abu Talib
pronounced the testimony before death, they are not very
trustworthy.574 Authentic reports are unambiguous about his death
on disbelief.

Wisdom in Abu Talib’s Death prior to the Establishment of
the Islamic State

1.

We have already stated above that Abu Talib died in the state of
disbelief for reasons best known to Allah 0g)575

2.

Maybe Allah willed that Abu Talib should die a disbeliever,
three years before Hijrah. Perhaps that is because he had played
a great role early in the Prophetic call (and its spread could be
attributed to his role). Otherwise, some people may imagine
that Islam was after all a tribal affair whose chiefs were looking
for leadership and political roles.576 Surely, there must be many
other reasons for Abu Talib to have died a disbeliever.

Note:
It is stated that by default Abu Lahab became the protector of
the Prophet gg (being the next chief) after Abu Talib's death.

574 From this is the narration of Ibn Ishaq that A1 'Abbas
saw Abu Talib
moving his lips, so he listened to him and heard him say what the
Messenger of Allah had asked him to say. The chain used by Ibn Ishaq
has an unnamed narrator. See As-Siyar wal-Maghazi, p. 238. See Ibn Hajar's
Al-Fath (15/41) and Al-lsabah (4/116-119), for reports other than this that
Ibn Hajar brought in rejection of the Shi'ah theory that he became a
Muslim. Dhahabi also rejected it in his Sirat, pp. 232-236.
575 See: "Pagan Methods of Resistance to the Call."
576 See Buti: Fiqhus-Sirah, the same reference as has been earlier stated, p. 51.

251

Initially, he bore the brunt. For instance, when Abu Ghaytalah
insulted the Prophet jig before him, Abu Lahab tried to defend him.
However, the Quraysh made efforts to dissuade him from standing
by the Prophet #g. They sent 'Uqbah bin Abu Mu'ayt and Abu Jahl
to ask him to inquire the Prophet s|g about 'Abdul-Muttalib. The
Prophet *ig replied, "with his people." Abu Lahab passed the
answer to the two. The two remarked, "He meant he is in the Fire."
Upon this Abu Lahab went back to the Prophet

and asked,

"Muhammad. Do you mean 'Abdul-Muttalib is in the Fire?" He
replied, "Whoever died on .what 'Abdul-Muttalib died, entered into
the Fire." Abu Lahab retorted, "By God. I shall remain an enemy
unto you so long as you believe that 'Abdul-Muttalib is in the Fire."
So, Abu Lahab as well as the rest of the Quraysh became angrier
with the Prophet s|§, and Abu Lahab withdrew the protection he
had provided to the Prophet.577
Note how frank and straightforward the Prophet Ig remained. He
did not appease anybody, no matter what the consequences.

Khadijah’s Death
Reports are varied over the date of Khadijah's death. It is said
that she died two months or, a month and five days, or, just three
days after the death of Abu Talib. There are other opinions. It is also
said that it happened in the month of Ramadan in the tenth year
after the Prophet's commissioning and three years before Hijrah.
This seems to be the most reliable version.578
When Abu Talib and Khadijah died one after another in a single
year, fresh problems arose. Abu Talib was a shield, while Khadijah

577 Mentioned by Ibn Kathir in Al-Bidciyah wan-Nihayah (3/147-148) and
ascribed it to Ibn Jawzi. He did not state the complete chain in order for a
judgment of its worth. All that can be said is that if it were true, then it
would settle the differences that prevail between the scholars over those
who fell in a period which did not witness a Prophet.
578 See the earlier discussion (Abu Talib s Death). Also see Dr. Qala ji.

sought consolation from her in difficult

There are many reports that speak of her high position

in Islam, and her importance in the sight of Allah and His
Messenger #§.580
One report says that with Abu Talib's death the Quraysh
began to behave with the Prophet g in a manner they wouldn't
have dared during his life. A young Qurayshite poured a handful
of dust on the Prophet's head.581 He entered his house with his
head covered in dust. One of his daughters washed his head while
she wept at the humiliation. The Prophet

told her, "Don't cry.

Your Lord will protect your father." He also remarked, "The
Quraysh could not have behaved with me in this manner during
Abu Talib's life."58" We have also mentioned earlier that once they
placed a camel's intestines over his shoulder while he was in
prostration.583
That year proved to be so difficult that some of the historians
have called it The Year of Grief'584 ('Amul-Huzn). However, it is not
reported that the Prophet
himself used the term.585
We are of the opinion that the true cause of grief was the fact
that the Prophet j|§ was now completely prevented from preaching
among the people. That the Quraysh had shut the door of the Call in
his face, was more painful to him than anything else.

Marriage to Sawdah
Despite the variety of problems the Prophet 3f§ faced in this
phase of his life, he did not become oblivious of the hardships that
his followers faced. Accordingly, in Shawwal of the tenth year after
his commissioning, he married Sawdah bint Zam'ah. She was an
early Muslim who had migrated to Abyssinia along with the second
batch of Muslims. She was in the company of her husband Sakran
bin ' Amr.586 He had died there. In appreciation of her situation, the
Prophet

married her.587 We shall have more to say on this

marriage when we discuss his wives, the Mothers of the Believers.

Journey to Ta’if
After the death of Abu Talib when the Quraysh were
encouraged to behave with the Prophet

in ways that they

would not have done during his life, the Prophet decided to travel to
Ta'if and seek the help of the Thaqif tribe. He had hoped that they
would embrace Islam,588 and, as a minimum, offer him protection.
Ibn Ishaq589 tells us that when he reached Ta'if he met with the

586 See his biography in Al-Isabah (2/59/no. 3337).
587 See her biography in Al-Isabah (4/338-339) where Ibn Hajar mentioned the
Ahadith and reports that were narrated in this connection. Also see
Tabari's Tarikh (3/161-162), Al-Isti'db (4/323) and As-Siyar wal-Maghazi, of
Ibn Ishaq, p. 254 as well as Al-Bidayah ivan-Nihdyah (5/331).
588 See Rm Hisham (2/69) without a chain; Ahmad: Al-Fathur-Rabbani (20/243)
with a perfect (Jaiyid) chain.

589Ibn Hisham (2/70-72) its chain is Good & Disconnected (Hasan-Mursal). He
did not however attribute the supplication and what happened after. It
was also reported briefly by Ibn Sa'd (1/211-212) in whose transmission
chain falls Waqidi. This report has a few differences in opinion to its
credit, e.g., his mentioning that Zayd bin Harithah was with him, while he
did not mention the supplication. Bayhaqi also reported it in his Dala'il
(2/414-417) tracing it through Musa bin 'Uqbah who took it from Zuhri.
Thus it is truncated through Zuhri. He too did not mention the
supplication. Imam Ahmad (4/335) reported it where the supplication is
mentioned. Suyuti also mentioned the supplication in Al-Jami'us-Saghir
and ascribed it to Tabarani, judging it Hasan. Albani said in the footnotes
of Fiqhus-Sirah of Ghazali, p. 132, as well as in Difa', p. 19, "Tabarani

chiefs of Thaqif tribe. They were three, all sons of 'Amr bin 'Umayr:
'Abd Yalil, Mas'ud and Habib. He offered them Islam. They refused
and scoffed at him. When the Prophet 3§| felt that there was no hope
they would accept the message, he requested them to keep the talk
to themselves so that the common people were not provoked
against him. But they refused that little courtesy, and sent behind
him their slaves, servants and urchins. They began to shout behind
him abusing him until a crowd started to follow him. They forced
him into an orchard owned by 'Utbah and Shaybah, sons of Rabi'ah.
The two were present in the orchard and had been watching the
events. As he entered the orchard, the crowd dispersed. He sat
down under the shadows of the grape trees.
When the Prophet ^ had settled he supplicated, "O Allah, unto
You alone do I complain of my weakness, lack of means and
helplessness before the people — O Most Merciful of the mercifuls. You
are the Lord of the weak, and you are my Lord. Whom do you entrust
me to, someone who treats me harshly, or to an enemy whom you
have given power over me? But if You are not angry with me, I do not
mind. Your satisfaction is a greater thing to me. I seek refuge by the
Light of Your Face that removes the darkness, and which sets things
right in this world and the Hereafter, that Your anger should descend
on me. Unto You I submit my will until You are pleased with me. And
there is no power nor might except Yours."
When Rabi'ah's sons saw him in that condition their hearts
softened. They ordered their Christian slave 'Addas590 to present
him with some dates. The Prophet
surprised 'Addas by saying
Bismillah before starting to eat. But, his surprise was reduced when
he learned that he was a Prophet. He began to kiss his forehead,
hands and feet. Rabi'ah's sons did not wish to see him being

recorded this Hadith in his Al-Kabir as a report of 'Abdullah bin Ja'far,
briefly." In it the supplication is mentioned. Haythami said in Iris Majma'
(6/35). In it falls Ibn Ishaq, who dropped down names of narrators,
although himself trustworthy. The rest of the narrators are reliable.
Therefore, the report is weak," because of Ibn Ishaq not naming the
transmitters.
590 See his biography in Al-lsabah (2/466-467/no. 5468).

influenced by the Prophet
So they told 'Addas, "Let him not
pervert you of your religion. Your religion is better than his."
(But 'Addas was convinced that he was a Prophet. What
happened was that when the Prophet m said Bismillah, 'Addas
reacted in surprise, "This is something that people of this area never
utter." The Prophet #| asked him, "And where are you from?" 'Addas
told him he was from Nineveh. The Prophet
remarked, "Ah. From
Yunus' city?" 'Addas was astonished, "How do you know?" The
Prophet
told him he knew because Yunus was a Prophet as he
himself was a Prophet. 'Addas told him that when he left Nineveh, no
more than perhaps ten people knew who Yunus was.
The report by Musa bin 'Uqbah591 says that the Ta'if urchins
had lined up in two rows waiting for him to pass by. As he did, they
wouldn't allow him lift a foot and place it on the ground but they
would aim at it with a stone. They kept on stoning him until his feet
started bleeding. This was the worst physical torture the Prophet
had ever been through.
Having received that rough treatment, the Prophet #§ took his
journey back to Makkah in grief. When he reached a place called
Qarnuth-Tha'alib, (i.e., Qarnul-Manazil), Allah (Ss) sent Jibril to him.
He was accompanied by an angel in charge of mountains. Jibril told
him that the angel was at his service. All he had to do was to say yes
to the destruction of the Ta'ifians. He will crush them between two
mountains. The Prophet
refused. But, the visit and the suggestion
added to his moral strength.
In this connection, Bukhari
and Muslim
have preserved
one of 'Aishah's reports. She asked him, "Did you ever experience a
day harder than that of Uhud?" He replied, "I received from my

591 Bayhaqi quoted it from him in Dala'il (2/414) and it is Mursal for it stops

that the reports that the biographers have stated about his migration effort
to Ta'if have an origin.

people a treatment that I received. However, the hardest that I
encountered was on the day of 'Aqabah when I presented myself to
Ibn 'Abd Yalil bin 'Abd Kilal. He did not respond positively. So I
started off and I was in quite some grief. I had reached QamuthTha'alib when I lifted my eyes to see a cloud covering me. I spotted
Jibril. He said, 'Allah has heard your people's answer to you. He has
sent an angel who is in charge of the mountains. You can give him
the instructions (you wish).' At that the other angel greeted me and
said, 'Muhammad. If you wish I could crush them between the two
mountains.'594 I told him, 'Rather, I hope those will appear from
their progeny who will worship Allah without associating others
with Him.'"
He received another moral boost before he entered Makkah. It
was the Islam of a few jinn. He stayed a few days in a valley near
Makkah called the Nakhlah Valley. Allah ($g) sent a few jinn to him
there. They listened to the Qur'an and declared their faith in him.
Allah spoke of the incident in chapters Al-Ahqaf and Al-Jinn of the
Qur'an. He said.

'And when We turned towards you a few of the jinn listening to
the Qur'an. When they went to him they said (to themselves), 'Be
attentive.' When (the recitation) was over they returned to their
kind, warning them. They said, 'Our people. We have heard a
Book that has been sent down after Musa, confirming what came
before it, guiding to truth and to the Straight Path. Our people!

594 They are the two mountains of Makkah. One of them is called Abu
Qubays, while the one that faces it is known as Qu'ayqi'an. Another
opinion is that they are Abu Qubays and Al-Ahmar mountains of Mina.

He stood up with renewed energy without any fear of the

opposition. When he made up his mind to enter the town (where he
could be killed, since Abu Lahab, the new chief of the Banu Hashim
had disowned him), Zayd his slave (who had accompanied him to
Ta'if) asked him, "flow will you re-enter the city O Prophet, when
they have turned you out?" He replied, "Zayd. You will see how

The Prophet of Islam

Allah smoothens the ground for me. Allah will help His cause and
give victory to His Prophet."
He sent a messenger to Akhnas bin Shariq asking him to
provide him protection. The man evinced lack of courage. He
sought excuse in that he was an ally of the Quraysh and an ally
could not offer protection (to the ally's enemy). Then he sought the
protection of Suhayl bin 'Amr. He too refused on grounds that
Banu 'Amr never offered protection in opposition to Banu Ka'b.
Then he sought the protection of Mut'im bin 'Adi. He assented
and prepared himself and his sons to protect him.601 Hassan bin
Thabit, the poet of Islam, said some beautiful verses in praise of
his decision. He said.
You protected Allah's Messenger from them and they (the
Muslims) became
Your slaves so long as the pilgrims say labbayk
If Ma'd and their families were asked about him
Or Qatan, or the rest of the Jurhum
They would say he faithfully keeps his covenant
And his protection, whenever protection is asked.602
The Prophet i§ never forgot Mut'im's favor, nor his role in

See Ibn Hisham's narration (92/24) - without a chain but brought out with
all the details; and Ibn Kathir in Al-Bidayah wan-Nihayah (3/151); Ibn Sa'd
(1/212) who took it from Waqidi. The latter did not deal with the incident
of the Prophet
seeking the protection of Akhnas and Suhayl, but rather
that the man who made a contact with Suhayl was called Urayqiz and
was from Khuza'ah, he ascribed the story to Umawi. Albani said in Difa‘
Anil-Hadith, p. 19, Tabarani reported the story briefly including the
supplication with the chain of Ibn Ishaq, tracing it through 'Abdullah bin
Ja'far. However, Ibn Ishaq was a suppressor of the name of the narrator
immediately before him. Sometimes he used the term, 'so-and-so- said, soand-so said.' Therefore the Hadith was treated weak (Fiqhus-Sirah by
Ghazali, p. 132). As for Ibn Sa'd, he did not mention the whole of the
story but stated a few words. In addition, the report with him is a
statement of Waqidi without a transmission chain.''
f,° See Ibn Hisham (2/23-24) who offers a narration of Ibn Ishaq which is
weak. Ibn Hajar mentioned it in Al-Fath (15/194). Fakihi mentioned
through a Hasan chain that Hassan bin Thabit composed an elegy in

getting the boycott lifted. He said on the day of Badr in reference to
the prisoners, "Had Mut'im been alive and asked me to release these
prisoners, I would have released them."603
The protection offered however, did not prevent the Prophet
and his followers from movements in connection with the
propagation activities. When some Muslims wished to migrate to
Abyssinia, Abu Bakr
happened to be one of those who thought
he could go along. But when he reached a place called BarkalGhimad, he met Ibn Daghinah. He was a chief of the area. He
brought him back to Makkah offering his protection saying, "A
man like you, O Abu Bakr, cannot leave and cannot be exiled..."
The Quraysh imposed the condition on Ibn Daghinah that Abu
Bakr should pray in his house alone. Abu Bakr complied. He built
a small place in the compound of his house for prayers. However,
when he prayed, women and children of the Quraysh gathered
around. His weeping at the recitation of the Qur'an attracted them.
The Quraysh got worried. The curious crowd could be won over
to Islam by the Qur'an. So they asked Ibn Daghinah to ask Abu
Bakr to pray inside his house so that no one could hear him. Ibn
Daghinah came to him and said, "Either you comply, or I'll
withdraw my protection." Abu Bakr told him, "Let me return your

remembrance of Mut'im bin 'Adi when he died as a reward for the
protection he had offered to the Prophet
603 Reported by Al-Bukhari/Al-Fath (12/226-227/H. 3139). Ibn Hajar said
explaining the words "I would have released them," i.e., without ransom.
Ibn Shahin offered another reason ... Ibn Ishaq offered the story in details.
Ibn Fakihi also presented it with a Hasan-Mursal chain. It says that Mut im
ordered his four sons to put on their armour and each one to stand at one
corner of the Ka'bah. When the news reached the Quraysh they said,
"You are a man whose protection cannot be violated." It is also said that
he was one of those who were fiercely opposed to the boycott agreement
that the Quraysh had made against Banu Hashim and Muslims. Waqidi
reported through a chain reaching Jubayr bin Mut'im that the Prophet
said, "Flad Mut'im bin 'Adi been alive, I would have gifted these to him.
Mut'im bin 'Adi had given protection to the Prophet 0, when he returned
from Ta'if. Its narrators are all reliable except for Waqidi who was
abandoned. Abu Dawud's words are (3/61/H. 2689), "I would have freed
them." Thus various trusted reports demonstrate that the incident of his
giving protection is authentic. It also proves the travel to Ta if.

260

The Prophet of Islam

protection hereby and seek the protection of Allah and His
Messenger."604
This stand was similar to that of 'Umar bin Khattab who
rejected the protection of Khalah 'Asi hoping to be in the protection
of Allah and His Messenger like anyone else of the weaker sections
of Muslims whom no disbeliever would give protection to.605

Lessons

1.

The Prophet's choice of the three leaders of Thaqif indicates the
importance of inviting those whom the people follow. When
they refused, it became obvious that the others would follow
suit. Hence he did not tarry long in Ta'if.

2.

The Prophet ^ demonstrated remarkable patience at Ta'if.
Despite the very painful treatment he received at their hands, he
did not pray against them. Instead, he prayed for their
guidance. Allah (3g) answered his prayer. It manifested itself a
decade later when the Thaqif tribe went to him as believers after
he had lifted the Ta'if siege and returned to Madinah.

3.

The jinn meeting him at Nakhlah is a proof of their existence. It
also shows that they are responsible and hence questionable
beings. Further, it is apparent that while some of them believed
him, others did not. Our source of knowledge about this is
the Qur'an itself.

4.

The jinn believing in the Prophet ig, after he had received the
treatment he received, was to console him and heal his wounds.
It was also to confirm that Allah was not going to abandon him.
If the peoples of the earth abandoned him, there were beings in
other worlds-angels and the jinn-who would believe in him

and help him. It was Allah who had turned the jinn—although
a progeny of Shay tan (Satan) —into believers and callers to
Islam. A Lord of such powers was capable of turning the
antagonist Quraysh and Thaqif disbelievers into believers and
callers to truth. Later, the events did take such a turn.606

5.

It was a practice in the days of Ignorance, that when asked,
protection was to be given. It is an important factor in modem
times too. Now it goes by the name of 'political contingency/ It is
also one of those things which the callers to truth can make use of.

6.

' Addas's acceptance of Islam provides evidence that the Prophet
did not return from Ta'if entirely unsuccessful. He returned
with what was better than red camels. 'Addas embraced Islam.607
The Prophet j|§ himself has said, "That Allah should guide by you
a single soul is better than red camels."608

7.

Surely, in the story of his venture to Ta'if and what he suffered
at the hands of the people there are lessons of consolation for the
callers to Islam. If the Messenger of Allah received the treatment
he received, then, it is likely that those passionately devoted to
the cause of Islam should receive a worse treatment. Accord¬
ingly, they should prepare themselves for that. This is the path
of the Messengers and Prophets, and Allah's Wisdom has set it
that this religion will not emerge victorious without effort.

606 See Dr. Muhammad Rawas Qala'ji: Qira'tun-Jadidah lis-Siratin-Nabawiyyah, p. 99.
607 See Al-Isdbah (2/466-467). Ibn Hajar offered evidences here to show that
'Addas believed in the Prophet Ig. One report he cited is that of Ibn Ishaq
that we have presented, its chain is of Hasan-Mursal status. Next,
Sulayman Taymi's in Sirat, it happens to be without a chain of transmis¬
sion; and a few other reports that are questionable, either textually or
chain-wise. Bayhaqi also -quoted it in his Dald’il (2/415-417) the story of
how 'Addas believed in the Prophet #g, it being a Mursal report of Zuhri.
In it falls Muhammad bin Fulayh who was trustworthy but given to
misgivings. All these narrations considered together strengthen each other
and prove that there is an origin to the Islam of 'Addas.

The Prophet of Islam

The Nocturnal Journey609 and Ascension610
This miracle followed the death of the Prophet's uncle (who
protected him from his enemies), the death of his wife (who shared
with him his hardships), and after he had received in Makkah and
Ta'if tortures and afflictions of the worst sort. Most narrations lead
us to believe that the event took place after the tenth year of his
commissioning. However, differences prevailed over when exactly
it happened after the tenth year.611 Musa bin 'Uqbah has narrated
on the authority of Zuhri and 'Urwah bin Zubayr612 that the Night
Journey to Baytil-Maqdis took place a year before the Prophet's
migration to Madinah.
It is also beyond dispute that the event of the Nocturnal Journey
and Ascension to the heavens did take place. The Qur'an spoke of it,
although not in direct terms, in two chapters: Al-Isra' and An-Najm.
In the first chapter of mention, Allah spoke of the Night Journey and
the wisdom behind it. He said,

What is meant here is the miraculous Journey made by the Prophet
from the Holy Mosque in Makkah to the Furthest Mosque in Jerusalem.
610 What is meant here is the miraculous Journey made by the Prophet $g
from the Holy Mosque in Makkah to Sidratul-Muntaha (Lote tree at the
utmost boundary).
611 See different statements mentioned in this regard by Ibn Kathir in Al¬
ii i day ah ivan-Nihayah (3/119); and Ibn Hajar: Al-Fat-h (15/49).
Maghazi of 'Urwah bin Zubayr, p. 120, with Mursal chains. We have
chosen Zuhri's version who quoted Musa bin 'Uqbah, and the version of
'Urwah because of Ibn Ma'in's statement who said, "Musa bin 'Uqbah's
narratives through Zuhri happen to be the most trustworthy of these
books:" Ibn Hajar in his Tahdhib (10/362), first print, India 1325/1327 H.
And because of the statement of Imam Ahmad: "You may resort to the
Maghazi of Musa bin 'Uqbah for he is reliable." [Dhahabi: TadhkiratulHuffdz (1/148), third print, India 1955]. And because of Imam Malik's
statement: "Resort to the Maghazi of 'Uqbah bin Musa for he was reliable."
His another statement is, "May you pay attention to the Maghazi of this
pious man 'Uqbah for it is one of the most trustworthy narrative of
expeditions." Nawawi: Tahdhibul-Asma' wal-Lughat (1/118). And, it is
enough that he is one of the narrators in Bukhari and Muslim. See footnotes
of Dr. A'zami on Maghazi of 'Urwah.

"Glorified is the One Who took His slave by night from the
Sacred Mosque (Grand Mosque at Makkah) to the Farthest
Mosque (Masjidul-Aqsa in Jerusalem) whose surroundings We
have blessed in order that We might show him Our signs. Surely,
He is the Hearer, the .Seer."613
In the other chapter, An-Najm, Allah spoke of the Ascension to
the heavens and the benefits thereof. He said.

"Surely he saw him (Archangel Jibril) a second time (in his
original form), near the furthest Lote Tree. Thereat is the Garden
of Abode. When the Lote Tree was covering what was covering.
The eye did not deviate, nor did it transcend. Surely, he saw
(there) great signs of his Lord."614
Many of the narratives of the Prophetic period in Makkah are
dedicated to describing this Journey. In Bukhari alone, the total
number of narratives reaches the figure of twenty, coming down
from six Companions. Muslim has eighteen reports originating from
seven Companions.615
Nonetheless, a single report describing the whole Journey in
every detail is not available. Every narration has some features

613 Surat Al-Isra1.
614 Surat An-Najm: 13-18.
615 See 'Urjun: Muhammad Rasulullah (2/357, 359). Shami said in As-Subul (3/
113): "Know, may Allaly have mercy upon me and upon you, that the
Hadith mentioned in Chapter seven carries different pieces of information,
so I sought Allah's counsel and put these Ahadith together to make an
agreeable story." See the story in chapter 8 (3/113-135) and the remarks
on some of the benefits of the story of Al-Mi'rdj and the explanation of
some of the difficult parts in the ninth chapter (3/136-242). They are,
altogether 111. The tenth chapter consists of Jibril's prayer along with the

264

The Prophet of Islam

described that are not found in others. We have combined the
reports to present them here as one whole, albeit abridged.

(i) The Opening of the Chest

Jibril came down on the blessed night of the Journey, opened
the roof of the Prophet's house in Makkah, slit his breast and
washed it with Zamzam water. Then he brought a tray filled with
wisdom and faith and filled his heart therewith. Then he closed it,
held him by his hand and rose up.616

(ii) The Nocturnal Journey

Anas 4* reports the Prophet
“Buraq was brought up to me. It
was a white creature, a little larger than a donkey but smaller than a
mule. It placed its foot at the end of the horizon. I mounted it. He
took me to Baytil-Maqdis (in Jerusalem). I tied it by the peg used by
earlier Prophets. I entered the Mosque and offered two Rak'ats
(units) of (prayer). As I came out Jibril brought me two bowls: one of
wine and the other of milk. I chose milk. Jibril remarked: 'Your
choice fell on nature.' Then he took me up to the heavens.''617 Other
reports suggest that he prayed with the previous Prophets before he
ascended. Adam and all those Prophets who followed him were
assembled and he led them in prayers.618

Prophet i|| on the night of the Journey and how the prayer was made
obligatory.
616See: Al-Bukhdri/Al-Fath (17/284/H. 4709, 4710) and (15-43-70/H. 3886,
3888) and (18/242/H. 4856, 4858) and Muslim (1/148/H. 163) and (1/151/
H. 164), Ibn 'Asakir: Tahdhib Tdrikh Dimashq (1/386-387).
617 Reported by Ahmad: Al-Fathur-Rabbdni (20/251-252) with a Sahih chain,
and Al-Bukhdri/Al-Fath (21/176/H. 5576) and Muslim (1/145/H. 162). See
Al-Bukhari/Al-Fatli (21/176/H. 5610).
Bayhaqi reported it in his Dald'il (2/388), and Dr. Qala'ji said in the
footnotes (2/387): Narrations strengthened each other to say that the
Prophet ^ led the Prophets in prayer before ascending to the heavens."

(iii) The Ascension

Thereafter he was raised to the heavens. At the gates of every
firmament Jibril asked to be let in. He was asked if he had company.
He would say yes and name Muhammad. They'd say "Welcome"
and open the gate. He met Adam at the first firmament, in the
second 'Isa and Yahya, in the third Yusuf, in the fourth Yunus, in the
fifth Harun, in the sixth Musa and in the seventh Ibrahim. He found
him sitting reclining on the Baytul-Ma'mur (which is the Ka'bah of
the heavens). Then he proceeded to the furthest point of the Lote
Tree where Allah declared obligatory fifty prayers a day for his
followers. When he met Musa while returning he asked, "What has
been declared obligatory on your people?" He told him about the
prayers. Musa told him to go back and seek reduction. He did that
and Allah reduced the number by five. But, when he came down,
Musa once again urged him to go back and seek reduction. It went
on, a reduction of five was granted every time he went back until it
was reduced to five prayers a day. Musa however wasn't satisfied.
He urged him to seek further reduction. But the Prophet
told him,
"I have been asking and asking. Now I feel ashamed to go." A caller
called saying, "I have declared the obligation and reduced the
burden from My slaves."619
The report of Anas
coming from Abu Dharr
has some other
details. Such as, the Prophet's words, "Then I was taken up to a point
from where I could hear the movement of the Pens." Thereafter he
spoke about the prayers being made obligatory. "Then," he
continued, "He took me further up until we reached the end of the
Lote Tree. It was covered by indescribable colors. After that I entered
into Paradise and lo! It was all domes with the land all musk."620

Ibn Hajar said: "That is apparent." He added, "There was consensus of
opinion among the Companions over the prayer in Jerusalem. See the
reports on this chapter collected by Imam Ahmad: Al-Fathur-Rabbani (20/
244-264), the chapters that speak of the journey by night of the Prophet m,.
619Al-Bukhdri/Fath (13/24/H. 3207), Muslim (1/149/H. 163) Ahmad: AlFathur-Rabbani (20/247-248) being a Hadith of Anas through Malik bin
Sa'sa'ah, with a Sahih chain; also An-Nasa'i (1/217).
620Al-Bukhdri/Al-Fath (3/9/H. 349), Muslim (1/149/H. 163).

266

The Prophet of Islam

Nawawi621 has at this point discussed in detail the Beatific
Vision mentioning the differences among the scholars over the issue.
He himself is inclined to believe that the Prophet j|§ saw his Lord.
He depended on the narration of Ibn 'Abbas
in which he said,
“Muhammad saw his Lord with his heart, twice."
I believe Ibn 'Abbas' choice of words also supports those who
maintain that the Prophet ^ didn't see his Lord.

(iv) The Return Journey

Reports give us to believe that the return Journey was also via
Baytil-Maqdis, to Makkah. Tirmidhi recorded on the authority of
Shaddad bin Aws, "... Then we moved on and passed by a Quraysh
caravan in such and such a place. Their camel had strayed away. Soand-so was in charge of them. I greeted them. Some of them
remarked, 'This is Muhammad's voice.' Then I returned to my
homefolk before dawn."622
Burdq was the means of travel for the Journey to and from
Baytil-Maqdis. Whereas, for the Journey up to the heavens, he
always used the word “I was raised up" ('urija bi) without telling us
of the means. Some reports say, “A ladder was set up"623 which he
used for ascension. To be sure, Burdq was not used for going up, as
some people have thought.

621 His commentary on Sahili Muslim (3/4-15/The Book of hndn, meaning of
the Verse, "And indeed he Muhammad
saw him (Jibril) at second descent.”)
See Tafsir Ibn Katliir (9/312-316), the discussion over the Prophet's Beatific
Vision, and who else discussed this issue. Also Shami discussed this
episode in As-Subul (3/82-93) presenting all kinds of opinions, and
perhaps he is of those who decided to remain uncommitted: neither saying
yes to the Prophet's Beatific Vision, nor denying it, because of the
conflicting evidences.
1,22 Bayhaqi reported it in his Dald'il (2/355-357) being a narration of AtTirmidhi attributed to Shaddad bin Aws. Bayhaqi said: "This is a Sahih
chain."
623 See Al-Bidayah wan-Nihayah (3/122).

From Birth to Emigration

267

(v) Quraysh’s Stand on the Nocturnal Journey and Ascension

The Prophet
was apprehensive that his people might refuse
to believe in him if he spoke to them about it. He felt a bit sad on
that score. It so happened that Abu Jahl met him and asked him
mockingly, "Anything new?" The Prophet
told him about his
Journey. Abu Jahl didn't wish to express his disbelief in fear that the
Prophet m might recant. Therefore, he asked him, "Supposing I
gathered some people, will you repeat the story to them?" When the
Prophet §f| said yes, he hurried away to gather the people. When
they came and the Prophet #| told them all that had happened, they
greeted him with skepticism. Someone who had been to Jerusalem
(while it was known that the Prophet J|g had never been there) asked
him to describe the Baytil-Maqdis. Allah brought it before his eyes
so that he was able to see and describe it. They said, "So far as the
description goes, he is O.K."624
Reports say that they refused to believe that he could go to
Sham and come back within one night whereas, they took two
months to do it. In fact, many of the Muslims also became apostates
on that ground.625
When Abu Bakr
was told of the story, he immediately
believed in him saying, "By Allah, if he said that, it must be true.
Why should you be in doubt about it? Doesn't he say that he
receives news from the heavens at any time of the night or day. Isn t
that more miraculous?" Then he went up to the Prophet
and
asked him to describe the place. When he had done that, he said,' I
testify that you are Allah's Messenger." The Prophet #| told him,

624Al-Bukhari/Al-Fath (17/284/H. 4710), and Muslim (1/156/H. 170) and
Ahmad: Al-Fathur-Rabbani (20/262-263) a Hadith of Ibn 'Abbas A with a
Sahih chain of transmission. The words here are those of Ahmad. See
Sa'ati's research on the report. Bayhaqi reported it in his Dalail (2/363364) as also others.
625 See Ibn Hisham (2/45) who copies a report of Ibn Ishaq through a
Suspended (Mu'allaq) chain. The fact of some Muslim's apostasy was
reported in authentic traditions. For example, what Hakim recorded in his
Mustadrak (3/62-63) declaring it reliable and which Dhahabi approved.

268

The Prophet of Islam

"You are Siddicj.” From that day Abu Bakr
the Siddiq.62b

came to be known as

(vi) Evidences that the Journey was with Body and Soul

Qadi 'Ayad627 has written: "Scholars have differed between
themselves with regard to the Prophet's Nocturnal Journey and
Ascension. It has been said that all of it took place in sleep. But the
truth on which the people are, along with most of the earliest
scholars, most of those who followed them, jurists, traditionists and
scholastics, is that he journeyed with his body. Most narratives point
to this fact, and any varied opinion will need to be substantiated..."
Ibn Hajar has said,6-S "The Nocturnal Journey and Ascension
took place, in the state of wakefulness, with the body and soul, after
the Prophet ^ had been commissioned. This is the opinion of the
great majority of scholars, Traditionists, jurists and scholastics. All
evidences point to this. It is not right to differ from this opinion. The
intellect plays no role in it, for it to resort to interpretations."
'Urjun has said,62J "This Ummah is one in this —except for a few
varied opinions which in fact have not come to us through
trustworthy reports such as those of 'Aishah, Mu'awiyah and
Hasan Basri. Allah (3g) opened chapter (Al-Isrti’) with the words of
glorification to symbolically express His Powers and that nothing is
greater than the Power of Allah ... Any opening with the mention of
the words of glorification, is not employed (in the Qur'an) except for
things extraordinary, such as those that reason does not easily
accept..." Then he adds, "The word 'Abd in the starting Verse is not
used in the Arabic language but for the body and soul together. So
also, the words, 'The eye did not deviate nor did it transcend' also

626 Reported by Hakim in Al-Mustadrak (3/62-63), where he said: "This is a
Hadith with a correct attribution, that the two did not include (in their
compilations)." Dhahabi approved it.

speak of someone with body and soul. Now, Hasan Basri's narration
was unknown in the time of the Companions. It is an entirely new
opinion. As for 'Aishah ^>, she was not yet the Prophet's wife at the
time of the Journey, in fact, she was too young at that time to
understand an event of this kind. She does not quote other people's
opinion on which her own opinion rests.630 In other words, this is
not a Hadith (a Prophetic narration). Moreover, Khafaji has shown
that the chain of narrators has Muhammad bin Ishaq in it, who was
treated as a weak narrator by scholars like Imam Malik and
others.631 In contrast, the narrations to the opposite view are
stronger..." Zurqani has said,632 "In fact, a careful study of her
words shows that she too was inclined to believe that the Ascension
was with body and soul. For, she denied that Muhammad
saw
his Lord with his eyes. If she had been of the opinion that the
Prophet
was in his sleep, she wouldn't have had to deny the
Vision. (What she would have said is that, "there is no point in
discussing the question of Beatific Vision, since, to begin with, he
was then sleeping— Translator.) As regards Mu'awiyah's opinion,
it was declared after the opinion had been reached by consensus
that the Journey was with the body and soul. It is another thing that
Mu'awiyah's opinion lacks a strong chain of transmitters, coming
down as it does, through Ibn Ishaq. Even if it is demonstrated that it
was truly his opinion, it would not be of much weight since it is a
personal opinion formed after the consensus of the Companions.
Such an opinion cannot undermine the consensus. As for Hasan,
two opinions have been reported as his. One of them says the
Prophet was then awake."

630 This is what Tyad said commenting on the Hadith of 'Aishah A- See AshShifa': (1/372) as verified by Rifa'i and his colleagues. And the Ayah is no.
17 of Surat An-Najm.

Again, if the Nocturnal Journey and Ascension took place in
sleep, there was no reason for the Quraysh to deny, nor would have
some of the Muslims apostatized, for what was the problem in
accepting that his soul ascended? Finally, the manner of presenta¬
tion of the incident in chapter Al-Isra' is strongly suggestive of the
fact that the Journey was made in an awakened state, with body and
soul, as 'Urjun and others have maintained.634

Lessons and Implications

1.

The Nocturnal Journey and Ascension are events accepted by
consensus of the Traditionists as well as biographers. They are also
confirmed by the Qur'an and Hadith. The evidence is over¬
whelming. The great majority of Muslims accept it as a miracle of
the Prophet
To deny it is to deny a well-known fact of Islam.

2.

The event came after the Prophet #§ had been through some very
rough times. It seemed to have come to increase his resolve and to
convey him the message that the people's reaction in no way
reflected Allah's own regard of him. The troubles of that period
were the way things are with Prophets of all times. But, in the end,
truth will prevail and Islam will be established. This was
symbolized by the fact that he was chosen to lead the past
Prophets and Messengers in prayers at one point during the
Nocturnal Journey. It also carried the message that if the earth was
too narrow for him, heaven was not. If the earthly beings rejected
him, those in the heavens were ready to receive him with honor.

3.

The proximity in time and space between his Journey to
Jerusalem and Ascension to the seven heavens was to demon¬
strate the importance of this House of God (Baytil-Maqdis) with
Allah. It was also indicative of the clear relationship between
what the two were sent with: 'Isa the son of Maryam, and
Muhammad the son of 'Abdullah, or between all the Messengers
and Prophets: all united in one cause.635 It is also indicative of the

<’3r'My allusion here is to the reliable report: "... The Prophets are paternal

responsibility of the Muslims to safeguard the earth against the
evil designs of the enemies of Islam.
4.

The wisdom in the Journey that used Baytil-Maqdis as a
stopover, instead of directly from the Grand Mosque at Makkah
to the furthest Lote Tree, was: The Jews had thrown away the
great honor of Revelation and Allah's commandments as things
worthless. Allah (0) cursed them and prophethood was taken
away from them forever, despite it having remained with them
for a long period of time. The raising of a new Prophet was the
announcement of the change in (moral and spiritual) leadership
from one people to another, from one land to another and from
the progeny of Israel to the progeny of Isma'il. The Journey to
Jerusalem was symbolic of the reverence that the place should
invoke having been the spiritual center for centuries.

5.

The Prophet's choice of milk over wine when the two drinks
were presented to him by Jibril, was to indicate that Islam is a
natural religion. For, milk is not a perverted form of some other
material, whereas wine is a chemically reprocessed form of
grape or other juices. In addition, wine perverts a man's nature
and robs him of his reason.

6.

In Allah's gathering together of the past Prophets and Messen¬
gers—the caravan of truth and guidance —in that blessed land
was, firstly, that they may welcome the receiver of the Last
Message. Secondly, it was a proof that Prophets and Messengers
acknowledge each other and that Muhammad is the Final
Prophet who completed the series. It also spoke of Muhammad s
special position among the Prophets and Messengers.

7.

The Prophet ^ witnessing some of Allah's great signs in the
kingdom of the heavens and the earth symbolically declared
machinations of the disbelievers as unworthy of note. It

The Prophet of Islam

contained a prophesy of their ultimate defeat while it also raised
the moral situation of the Prophet

and his followers in their

struggle against the disbelievers and their followers.
8.

An event of such magnitude taking place thirteen years after the
commissioning, was a proof that a palpable miracle had come
and that more would come in the future as a means to honor
and console the Prophet

without taxing the intellect (of the

onlookers). In this way this miracle was different from those of
the other Prophets — e.g., that of Musa — in that the miracle was
not made a means for forcing his nation to either come to terms
with him or get destroyed. Accordingly, we see that when the
Prophet 3|| was asked to go up into the heavens as a
demonstration of a miracle, the answer given by Allah was.

"Say: Glory to my Lord. Am I any more than a Messenger?"637
Nevertheless, when he actually went, it was not said to the
disbelievers that this was in answer to their demand.
9.

The declaration of the five daily prayers as obligatory during
the Ascension is a proof of its importance in the Islamic system
of life. The five daily prayers ought to be, so to say, a means of
spiritual ascension for the believers every time their inner souls
get too engrossed in material affairs.638

In Search of Tribal Support
The Prophet

was constantly in search of a place to which he could

emigrate where peaceful devotion to Allah could be assured. That was
the reason he had allowed his followers to emigrate to Abyssinia and the
reason why he had been to Ta'if. Thereafter he offered himself to the
adjoining tribes. The Hajj and Arab market-seasons were suitable for
meeting important men and chiefs of tribes, as well as the common

637 Surat Al-Isra': 93.

273

people. He sought from them help, support and protection without the
condition that they should believe in his Message.639
Those days he used to address the people in these words: "O soand-so. I am the Messenger of your Lord towards you.640 He commands
you to worship Him; associate not aught with Him; abandon what you
worship besides Him; and that you should believe in me and protect me
so that I can present to the people what I have been sent with."641
However, Abu Lahab would follow him in close range. When
the Messenger was through with his offer, he would shout out,
"People, do not give up the religion of your forefathers giving up
the Lat and Uzza deities and breaking the ties with the Banu Malik
bin Uqaysh, falling into the innovation this man has brought."642
The tribes from whom the Prophet 0% sought protection but who
refused included: Kindah — their chief was Mulayh or Fulayh;643 Banu

619 See: Maghazi Rasulullah by 'Urwah, pp. 117, a Hadith of Ibn Lahy'ah and
stopping short at 'Urwah. It is therefore Disconnected (Mursal). Bayhaqi
also recorded it in his Dalail (2/414) as a report of Musa bin 'Uqbah
through Zuhri, with a Mursal chain. However, these two Mursal reports
have their basis in Sahih reports as in the footnote after this.
640 Reported by Abu Dawud in his Sunan (5/The Book of Sunnah/H. 4734);
Ibn Mdjah in the Introduction (Chapter 12, p. 73/H. 201); Ahmad: Al-Fath
(20/267) being a Hadith of Jabir 4b. Dhahabi mentioned it in his Sirat, p.
282, and said: "According to the conditions laid by Bukhari."
641 Reported by Ibn Ishaq through a chain that includes Husayn bin 'Abdullah
who was weak — Ibn Hisham (2/74); As-Siyar wal-Maghazi, p. 232. Reported
by Ahmad also: Al-Musnad (3/4920 and (4/341), through a chain other than
that of Ibn Ishaq. Sa'ati said in Al-Fath (20/216-217 and 65): "It has a Perfect
(Jaiyid) chain." The two verifiers of Zadul-Ma'ad (3/44): "Its chain is Hasan,
with a supporting narration in Ibn Hibban (1683) being a report of Tariq bin
'Abdullah Muharibi. It was also reported by Tabarani in Al-Kabir, (5/56-63/
H. 4583-5690). Some of them are through routes similar to Ahmad and Ibn
Ishaq. See its meaning in Al-Mustadrak (2/164) under the Hadith of Jabir.
Hakim evaluated it as Salph and Dhahabi agreed to it.
642 This was mentioned in the narration of Ahmad and Ibn Ishaq mentioned
above. According to a version in Ibn Ishaq in As-Siyar wal-Maghazi, p. 232,
through a Hasan chain being a narration of Tariq Muharibi, his uncle Abu
Lahab used to follow him and stone him till his ankles bled.

'Abdullah of the Kalb644 tribe, Banu Hanifah, whose response was
harsh;645 Banu 'Amir bin Sa'sa'ah. One of their men who was called
Bayharah bin Firas remarked, "By God. If I could win over this man I
could eat the Arabs... What do you have to say? Supposing we
followed you and God gave you victory over the Arabs, will the rule of
the land be for us?" The Prophet
replied, "Sovereignty rests with
Allah. He places it where He wills." He remarked, "Should we offer
our necks to the Arab swords for your sake and when you have
overcome their resistance, sovereignty be for others? We have no use
for your mission."646 He also presented himself to Muharib bin
Khasafah, Fazarah, Ghassan, Murrah, Sulaym, 'Abs, Banu Nadr,
Banu Bakka', 'Udhrah, Hadarimah,647 Rabi'ah, Banu Shayban who
were headed by Mafruq bin' Amr, Hard bin Qabisah and Muthanna
bin Harithah. They sought excuses on various grounds, one of them
having the lack of assurance of ultimate political power, Muthanna
said, "One problem is, we have lately entered into a pact with the
Persians to the effect that we shall neither alter the borders with them
nor give refuge to anyone who endeavors to do so. And, as I see it, you
have brought something that the rulers of the world do not appreciate.
Had it been an inter-Arab struggle, we could have made an attempt.
(But to defy the Persians would be rather difficult)." The Prophet #§
told them that by being frank in their talk and decent in their behavior
they had mitigated the effects of their rejection. However, the nature of
the religion that he had brought could not be taken up as a cause,
except by accepting the whole of it. "Would you then," he asked them,
"like to wait for a while (and not oppose me actively) until Allah has
bequeathed you their lands, property and women? Will you then
praise Allah and exalt Him then?" (Meaning, will you become
Muslims?) Nu'man bin Sharik said, "Yes, by Allah." In reply, the
Prophet m recited to them the Verse:

of Waqidi.

"Surely, We have sent you a witness (to truth), giving glad
tidings, a Warner, one calling to Allah by His leave, and a
gloiving lamp."648
The Prophet ^ was pleased with their good behavior.649
It were the Madinan people who responded most positively to
his call. When he offered Islam to Suwayd bin Samit he neither
announced his own acceptance nor did he remain unconcerned. He
praised the Qur'an when recited to him. He returned to his people
almost convinced of the truth of Islam. He died in the Bu'ath battle.
Some of his tribesmen used to say that he died a Muslim.650
Ibn Ishaq651 has a report that a delegation from Banu 'AbdulAshhal came down to Makkah in their effort to enter into a pact
with the Quraysh against their Khazraj enemies. They were led by
Abu Haysar and Anas bin Rafi'. They were also accompanied by
Iyas bin Mu'adh. When the Prophet sp heard of them he went up to
them and sat down with them for talks. He asked them, "Are you
interested in something better than what you came here for?" They
asked, "What could that be?" He replied, "I am a Messenger of
Allah. He has sent me to the people to invite them to worship none
but Allah, associating not aught with Him. He has also sent down a
Book to me." Iyas bin Mu'adh, then a very young man, remarked,
"My people! Surely this is better than what you have come here
for." Abu Hayser reproached him (for talking too much). So he
stayed quiet. It is said that his people heard him declaring Allah's
Divinity, acknowledging His Greatness and praising Him at the
time of his death. They were sure he died a believer. Obviously, Iyas

649 The story of the Prophet
meeting with Rabi'ah was reported by Ibn
Hibban in his Sirat, pp. 93-101.
650 The full story was reported by Ibn Ishaq through an Interrupted (Munqati') chain,
because of the dropping of names of several narrators — Ibn Hisham (1/77-79).
651 Ibn Hisham (2/80-81) narrated through a Hasan chain.

The Prophet of Islam

had picked up the message of Islam at that meeting.
In the eleventh year after commissioning,652 the Prophet 3|!
sought the help and support of some Khazraj people. He had met
them at 'Aqabah (in Mina). They sat down with him listening. He
recited the Qur'an to them and invited them to Islam. What had
made them inclined to accepting it was that they lived by the Jews
as their neighbors. They knew that they were the holders of the
Book, and pretty knowledgeable. Whenever a dispute arose
between them and the Jews, the Jews did not fail to remind them
that, "A Messenger, awaited for quite a while, was about to appear.
When he appears We shall (be with him) and destroy you in the
manner 'Ad and Iram were destroyed."
When the Prophet 3§; invited them to Islam, they began to cast
searching looks at each other. They said, "By God you know that he
is the same Prophet the Jews have been talking of. So, let them not
outsmart you." Therefore, they all embraced Islam. They told him
then, "We have left our people in contempt and hatred of each
other. Maybe Allah will unite them by you. We shall go to them and
present them with what you have brought. We shall tell them about
ourselves having embraced Islam. Maybe Allah will unite them
under you. If that happens then no one will be more powerful than
you."
They left him after that, promising to return the next year
during the same season.
When they reached Madinah they spoke to their people about
the Prophet
and invited them to Islam. They kept propagating
the message until Islam began to spread among them. A point was
reached when not a family of the Ansar was left but Islam had

652 Ibn Ishaq thought they were six — Si rat Ibn Hisham (2/82). Ibn Kathir said
in Al-Bidayah wan-Nihdyah (3/164): “Musa bin 'Uqbah however, according
to a narration he has from Zuhri, and from 'Urwah bin Zubayr that they
were eight. Ibn Sa'd mentioned both the two opinions. When he spoke of
the narratives which fixed the number as six, which happens to be Ibn
Ishaq's narration, he said, “Muhammad bin 'Umar Waqidi said, 'This is
what is well established about them, which is unanimously believed." See
At-Tabaqat (1/219).

entered into it.653
There was another factor which had helped in softening their
attitudes. It was the Bu'ath battle.654 Bukhari655 informs us on the
authority

of

'Aishah

'$*>:

"The

preparation for the Prophet

battle

of

Bu'ath

was

Allah's

because of which he was able to

penetrate (with his message). That was the day when their chiefs
were dispersed, their leaders killed and they were left badly injured.
Thus Allah prepared them- for the acceptance of Islam."

653 Narrated by Ibn Ishaq as a Hadith of 'Asim bin 'Umar, narrating from the
elders of his people. He insisted that it is a Hadith —Ibn Hisham (2/81-83).
The two verifiers of Sirat Ibn Hisham declared the report weak because of
the unknowability of the elders. Dr. 'Awdah however thought that the
Hadith could be treated as Hasan because the elders in question were
Companions of the Prophet
from whom 'Asim used to narrate, such as,
Jabir, Mahmud bin Labid, and his grandmother Rumaythah. See 'Awdah:
As-Siratun-Nabawiyyah, p. 231, and we agree with him.
Ibn Sa'd (1/217-219) also reported this Hadith through Waqidi. That report
has additional information such as the Prophet's request that he be
protected until he could deliver the message of his Lord. They refused
until they could work out peace between themselves in Madinah. 'Urjun
however states that this is the first 'Uqbah Pledge, the one that followed it
(12) is the second, and the one that followed it (73 persons) was the Great
Pledge. See Muhammad Rasulullah and Muslim (2/379 and what follows).
654 Ibn Hajar said while explaining the Hadith of 'Aishah A in Al-Fath (14/
1262/H. 3777): "It is a place. Some said a fort. Another opinion is that it
was a farm belonging to Banu Qurayzah about two miles from Madinah.
A fight took place between the Aws and the Khazraj at that place, where
many of their chieftains had been killed. That was five years before Hijrah.
Some said five, others more, but the first opinion is the correct one So lots
of their chieftains were killed most of whom were too proud to enter into
the fold of Islam to be submitted to anyone's rule. 'Abdullah bin Ubaiy
bin Salul was also of that nature."

before the callers to truth, acting exactly like Abu Lahab acted
against his nephew Muhammad jg. Whenever they have the
means, they will use them to spread the notion that the callers are
the misguided ones, inviting people to a new religion, or,
outright, a fifth column. The Prophet $| did not take notice of Abu
Lahab. He kept working on his mission. The callers therefore,
should not feel seriously concerned about this class of men.
2.

It is necessary for the callers to knock on every door that they think
will open for them new opportunities for their religion. They
should not be disheartened by initial rejections; no matter how
often they have to repeat their efforts with individuals or groups.
They should and not be disheartened by the immediate results.

The First ‘Aqabah Pledge
The next year, which happened to be the twelfth year after
commissioning, twelve Madinan Muslims came down for Hajj.
Some of them were among those who had met the Prophet of Islam
the year before and had embraced his call. They met the Prophet
and some of his Companions in a place called 'Aqabah (at Mina).
They entered into a pledge with him. Bukhari,656 Muslim,6"1'
Nasa'i,658 Ahmad,659 Ibn Ishaq,660 Ibn Sa'd661 and others have
preserved the report of Ubadah bin Samit who was of those
Muslims who had come down for Hajj from Madinah. What they
report about the pledge is as follows:
'Ubadah said, "The Prophet
told them, 'Give me your pledge
that you will not associate aught with Allah. You will not steal,
commit fornication, will not kill your children, will not slander
(women) and will not disobey me in anything good and virtuous.
Then, whosoever remained true to his pledge will have his reward
656 Al-Fath (15/74/H. 3892) and the words are his.
657 Sahih Muslim (2/1331/H. 1709).

660Ibn Hisham (2/85-86), via a Hasan chain.

with Allah, and whosoever committed an evil, and Allah concealed
it, his affair is with Allah: He might punish if He will or forgive if He
will.”' So they took the pledge on those words.
In the report with Ibn Ishaq, 'Ubadah said,662 "So we pledged
with the Prophet, a women's pledge.663 That was at a time when
fighting was disallowed."
When they were ready to return to their lands, the Prophet
sent with them Mus'ab bin 'Umayr to recite to them the Qur'an,
teach them Islam and instruct them in their religion. He came to be
referred to as the 'Madinan Reciter.' He stayed in Madinah with
As'ad bin Zurarah.”664
Abu Dawud,665 Ibn Ishaq61’6 and others have reported on the

662 Ibn Hisham (2/86).
663 This is in reference to the pledge between the Prophet
and the Muslim
women, on the second day after the fall of Makkah, as we shall see later
in this book. That report does not speak of pledge on Jihad.
664 See in this connection Ibn Ishaq, who quotes without a chain and Ibn
Hisham (2/86); Bayhaqi in his Dald'il (2/438) and Dhahabi in his Sirat, p.
294, reporting Musa bin 'Uqbah quoting Zuhri to the effect that he sent
him toward them after he had met six persons near 'Aqabah. He also
reported in his Dald'il (2/438) through Ibn Ishaq as a narration of 'Asim
bin 'Umar, however, in Disconnected (Mursal) form that the Prophet ^
sent him after them, after they had written to him. He also quoted in his
Dald'il through Ibn Ishaq, a report handed down by 'Abdullah bin Abu
Bakr and 'Abdullah bin Mughirah bin Mu'ayqib, that the Prophet
sent
Mus'ab bin 'Umayr together with the twelve persons who had taken the
pledge during the First Aqabah Pledge. Ibn Sa'd (1/220) reports that the
Prophet
sent him to them when they wrote him after returning to
Madinah, requesting him to send someone who could teach them the
Qur'an. However, the chain of transmission consists of Waqidi. In any
case, I found that there are two narratives with Ibn Ishaq that say that the
Prophet
sent Mus'ab along with the Ansar when they returned. A third
report says that he sent him after they had left and had asked for him to
be sent. This agrees with the report of Ibn Sa'd and the two statements
can be reconciled by saying that there were six persons who first became
Muslims. They requested him to send someone as a teacher. So he sent
him after the next Hajj season along with the twelve mentioned here.
665 Sunan Abu Dawud (1/645-646/H. 1069).
666 Through a Hasan chain from Ibn Hisham (2/87). Others have also reported

authority of 'Abdur-Rahman bin Ka'b bin Malik that the first to
establish Friday prayer in Madinah was As'ad bin Zurarah. When
they became forty in number, Mus'ab bin 'Umayr led them in
prayers. The Prophet jgg had written to him that he was to assemble
them for the Friday prayers.667
Quite many people of the Ansar embraced Islam at the hands of
Mus'ab who worked in cooperation with As'ad bin Zurarah. Of the
important figures that embraced Islam were Usayd bin Hudayr and
Sa'd bin Mu'adh. In fact, the day the two embraced Islam, the whole
of Banu ' Abdul-Ashhal, to the last man and woman,668 entered into
the fold of Islam, except for Asayram, 'Amr bin Thabit bin Waqsh.
He delayed his Islam until the Uhud battle, embracing Islam that
very day, taking part in the battle, and getting killed before he could
prostrate himself to Allah once. When the Prophet

was told about

him he remarked.669
No Ansar family was left but some of its men or women had
embraced Islam, except for the houses of Banu Umaiyah bin Zayd,
Khatmah, Wa'il, Waqif, and the so-called Awsullah, that is, Aws bin
Harithah. The poet Abu Qays bin Aslat was from the last mentioned
family. They obeyed him in all affairs. He restrained them until the

668 Ibn Ishaq has reported through a Hasan chain the Islam of Usayd, Mu'adh,
Banu 'Abdul-Ashhal, but it is a Disconnected (Mursal) report for it stops at
'Abdullah bin Abu Bakr and 'Ubaydullah bin Mughirah bin Mu'ayqib —
Ibn Hishdm (2/88-90).
669 Ibn Ishaq in his book As-Siyar wal-Maghdzi, mentioned the story that tells
of his late entry into Islam, and his story on the day of Uhud, through a
reliable chain, through Abu Hurayrah 4b, as reported by Ibn Hajar in AlFath (11/286). Bukhari preserved the story of the day of Uhud without
citing his name — Al-Fath (11/286/H. 2808), and Muslim (3/1509/H. 1900);
Abu Dawud (3/43/H. 2537), but he did not mention the Prophet's words,
“He made small efforts but achieved great results."

before the
next year's Hajj, that is, the twelfth year after commissioning, to
convey to the Prophet
the good news of the success of his mission
at Madinah by the grace of Allah.671

The Second ‘Aqabah Pledge
A large number of Madinan Muslims came up to Makkah to
perform the pilgrimage at the head of the thirteenth year after
commissioning. They were a part of a larger group of pagans from
Madinah. The Muslims were led by a man called Bara' bin
Ma'rur.672
The Madinan Muslims questioned each other about how long
they should allow the Prophet
to wander about between the
Makkan mountains, rejected and fearful of his life.673
Several secret meetings took place between them and the
Prophet jjfe. Finally, a large meeting was decided and a place chosen.
It was to ratify a treaty that happens to be one of the most important
treaties in the annals of human history.
Ibn Ishaq674 reports this event through Ka'b bin Malik. He
said, "...We went up for pilgrimage. During the middle of the stay
at Mina we agreed on meeting the Prophet ^ at 'Aqabah. When
the pilgrimage was over and the night in which we were to meet

arrived, we slept with our co-travelers as usual. When a third of
the night had passed, we came out moving secretly, cat-like, to
meet the Messenger of Allah. We assembled in a narrow pass at
'Aqabah. We were seventy-three, two of whom were women:
Nusaybah bint Ka'b (Umm Umarah) and Asma bint Amr bin
'Adi (Umm Mani').
"We assembled in the pass waiting for the Prophet £g;. He came
with 'Abbas bin 'Abdul-Muttalib. The latter was still on the religion
of his people. He was there to see that the affairs were settled to
satisfaction. When we had settled down he said, O Khazraj people
(the Arabs used to call the Khazraj and Aws of the Ansni as the
Khazraj people). As you know, Muhammad is of us. We have
protected him from our people like we protect ourselves. So far, he
has the strength and support of his tribe with him and is well
protected. However, he wishes to abandon this and join you. Now,
if you think that you will take good care of him, protecting him
against Iris adversaries, then go ahead and act on your resolve. For,
don't forget that at present he has the strength of his tribe with him
and is well protected in his land and among his people.' We said,
'We have heard your words. Now, you should speak on O
Messenger of Allah #| and choose for yourself and your Lord
what you think is best.'
"Thereafter the Prophet
spoke to them. First he recited some
Qur'an, invited to belief in Allah and inspired them with the love for
Islam. After that he added, 'I seek your pledge that you will protect
me as you protect your women and children. Bara bin Ma rjur took
him by his hand and said, 'By Him who sent you a Messenger with
the truth, we shall protect you from what we protect our children.
So, we take the pledge O Messenger of Allah. And we are, O
Messenger of Allah, men of war and weapons that we have
inherited from generation after generation.' But, even as Bara' was
speaking to the Prophet #§, Abu Haytham bin Tayhan spoke out
saying, 'O Messenger of Allah. We have a treaty with the people.

Hakim in Al-Mustadrak, adding, "This is a Sahih report that the two
(Bukhari and Muslim) did not record." Dhahabi said, "Sahih.” Albani said
in the footnotes of Ghazali's Fiqhus-Sirah, p. 159, that the Hadith is Sahih.

(meaning the Jews). We shall repudiate it. But, the question is, do
you think if we did that and Allah gave you victory, you will leave
us and come back to your people?' The Prophet
smiled and said,
'Rather, my blood is your blood and my life is your life.675 I am of
you and you are of me. I shall fight him who fights you and make
peace with him whom you make peace with.'"
"Agreements had been reached over the conditions of the
pledge. But before the actual pledge would start, two men of the
Ansar — 'Abbas bin 'Ubadah bin Nadlah and As'ad bin Zurarah—
who had embraced Islam one or two years earlier, wished to warn
their people of the dangers of their resolve. They wanted their
people to be aware of the risks they would be facing by the pledge
and be sure of their readiness to fight. Ibn 'Abbas bin Nadlah said,
'Do you realize what it means to be pledging your hands to this
man?' They replied, 'Yes, we do.' He said, 'You are pledging to fight
the whites and the blacks. Therefore, if you think that when your
wealth is visited by destruction, and your best men by death, then,
at that point, you will hand him over (to his enemies), then
withdraw right now. For, by Allah, if you did that, it would mean
humiliation in this world and the Hereafter. But, if you feel you will
keep the word of promise at the cost of destruction of your wealth
and death of your noble men, then go ahead and take him with you,
for, by Allah, that would be one of the best things for this world and
the next.' They said in reply, 'We shall take him with us at the risk of
our wealth and death to our noble men. But, the question is, what
do we get in return, O Messenger of Allah?' He replied, 'Paradise.'
They said, 'Stretch your hand.' When he did that, they pledged their
fealty to him."676
When the people were ready for the pledge, As'ad bin Zurarah
interrupted again saying, "Take it easy, O Yathribites. We didn't
come to him but in full knowledge that he is a Messenger of Allah,
and that taking him with us would mean to part ways with the rest
z'

675 Ibn Hisham (2/96) said: It means inviolability. That is, my protection is
your protection, my inviolability is your inviolability.

of the Arabs, laying the lives of the best of your men, and that
swords could cut you down. If you think you can persevere through
these trials, go ahead and take him with you. And, of course, your
rewards will be with Allah. But, on the other hand, if you have any
reservation, then leave him where he is now. Such a course of action
would be easier to win Allah's pardon." They told him, "O As'ad.
remove your hand. We shall never let go this opportunity and shall
not betray our promise."677
When As'ad had got his people's determination reconfirmed, he
placed his hand on the Prophet's, making a pledge. His people
followed him in taking the oath, everyone of them, man after man,
receiving the good news of Paradise unto him who would stay true
to his pledge.678
As regards the two women's pledge, Ibn Ishaq6'9 says that it is
thought that they too placed their hands in the Prophet's although
the Prophet s|| was not used to taking women's hands into his. In
later days he would simply say the words of oath and when they
had said they were willing, he would say, "You may go now. I have
taken your pledge."
When the oath-taking was over, the Prophet Hg told them,
"Nominate twelve of you as monitors over you." They nominated
nine from Khazraj and three from Aws. They were:

677 A discussion over this narration has preceded that of Ahmad through
Jabir 4*- It is Sahih and contains the conditions of the pledge.
67HSee the Hadith of Jabir quoted earlier. Ibn Ishaq mentioned through a
Hasan chain that the first one to clasp the Prophet's hand to make a
pledge was Bara' bin Ma'rur. On the other hand he narrated without a
chain that the Banu Najjar claimed that it was As'ad bin Zurarah who
pledged first, whereas, Bani Abdul-Ashhal say that the first one was Abu
Haytham bin Tayhan. See Ibn Hisham (2/101). Probably each considered
what transpired between their tribes and the Prophet #|, otherwise, the
better known fact is that it was As'ad bin Zurarah who was the first, for
he was the leader of the Hajj group, and a fort for the mission of Islam in
Madinah. See Ar-Rahiq Al-Makhtum, p. 168, footnote.
619 Ibn Hisham (2/120) without a chain. What Ibn Ishaq reported is affirmed
by Bukhari in same meaning, see Al-Fath (20/99/H. 5288); Muslim (3/
1489/H. 1866) and others.

Mundhir bin 'Amr, Usayd bin Hudayr, Sa'd bin Khaythamah,
'Abdullah bin Hararrt, Rafi' bin Malik, and Abu Haytham bin

Ibn Ishaq681 has listed the names of everyone of the
seventy-three that took the pledge that night.
Ibn Ishaq682 reports that the Prophet $| told the monitors, "You
are custodians over your people similar to the custodians of 'Isa bin
Maryam's apostles, while I am the custodian over the people —i.e.,
the Muslims in general." They said yes in consent.
Bukhari,68" Muslim684 and Ibn Ishaq685 have given us the
articles of the pledge. But, tracing it through Jabir 4&, Ahmad686 and
Bayhaqi68/ give us the details that others missed. Jabir said "We

the two reports are brought together, then they represent the narration of
Ibn Ishaq. And the chain of the Hadith (7199) too are the same as those of
Ibn Ishaq. Ibn Hajar noted that this took place at the second 'Aqabah, see
Al-Fath (27/8).
684Sahih Muslim (3/1470/H. 1709), with a similar chain as of Ibn Ishaq as it
is in Bukhari in The Book of Ahkdm: Al-Fath {27/223/H. 7199, 71200) and
in the same words as of Ibn Ishaq.
685 Ibn Hisham (2/108) and its narrators are trustworthy except Ibn Ishaq, and
he explicitly stated it Was a Hadith and hence its chain is of Hasan grade.
686Al-Fathur-Rabbani (20/270). Hakim traced it in Al-Mustadrak (2/624-625)
declaring it Sahih and Dhahabi agreeing with him. Ibn Kathir said in AlBiddyah wan-Nihayah (3/175): "This chain is Perfect (Jaiyid) following
Muslim's conditions, although he did not trace it." Ibn Hajar said in AlFath (15/75) that the chain is Hasan. Albani said about it in the footnotes
of Fiqhus-Sirah of Ghazali j(p. 157): "It has a weakness, viz., a 'so-and-so'
by Ibn Zubayr who was known for removing names of narrators above
him. But the narrative of Layth bin Sa'd is not through him, and therefore,
its trustworthiness or just acceptability will depend on supportive
elements. Allah knows best. See Sa'ati's tracing of the Hadith.
687See the narration of Jabir in Dalail of Bayhaqi (2/443). As for the report
through 'Ubayd bin Rifa'ah, it is in Dalail (2/452). Ibn Kathir said in AlBidayah (3/18) in reference to the narration of 'Ubayd: "This is a Perfect &

asked, 'O Messenger of Allah. What's the pledge over?' He replied,
1.

'On hearing and obeying — in easy as well as straitened
circumstances.

2.

On expending in charity — in prosperity and poverty.

3.

On enjoining the virtuous and forbidding the evil.

4.

That you should stand up for Allah, unmindful of criticism of
the critic.

5.

And that you will help me when I come to you, protecting me
against whatever you protect your women and children against.
In return, you will have Paradise.'"
The above are the words of Ahmad.

Ibn Ishaq's report comes from Ibn Samit who said, "We
pledged our hands to the Prophet 0; on hearing and obedience, in
ease and difficulties, pleasing to us or displeasing, preferring it over
our own selves, that we shall not dispute the affairs with those given
charge, that we shall speak the truth wherever we are, fearing not
the criticism of the critic."
By the time the oath-taking ceremony was over, the monitors
appointed, and the people were about to leave the place, Shaytan
(Satan) got wind of the pledge. In order that the pagans pounce
upon the Muslims before they dispersed, he shouted out from the
peak of a mountain in the highest pitch possible, "O people of Mina.
Are you interested in the reproached one and those of his
companions who gave up their (ancient) religion, who have
gathered declaring war on you?" The Prophet
said, "This is
Azabb (name of the Shaytan) who lives in 'Aqabah. He is the son of
Azib." (Then, addressing the Shaytan,) "As for you, O enemy of
Allah, we shall soon free ourselves for you."

Strong (Jaiyid-Qawi) chain, although they didn't trace it." Dr. Sulayman
Sa'ud said in his thesis on Hijrah, p. 92: It is a weak Hadith through this
chain, but it gets stronger with the previously mentioned reports about the
conditions laid for the pledge like the report of Jabir."

From Birth to Emigration

287

When they had heard Shay tan's cry 'Abbas bin 'Ubadah bin
Nadlah said, "By Him Who has sent you with truth, if you wished
we could fall upon the people of Mina (pagan pilgrims) tomorrow
with our swords." The Messenger ^ told them, "We haven't been
ordered that yet. For the moment, return to your tents." So they
returned and slept peacefully till the morning.688
Ka'b bin Malik reported, "The next day a few chosen men of the
Quraysh came to our tents,and said, 'O Khazrajites. We learn that
you have come here to take our man away with you and that you
are pleading to fight us. But, you must understand that there is no
tribe on the earth that we would hate more, than fighting you.' So,
(continues Ibn Samit,) we sent a few pagans from amongst us to
assure them in God's name that there was no such move —at least
not in our knowledge. And (Samit added,) they spoke the truth
because they knew nothing about it. (Samit also added,) We
pretended to look into each other's faces questioningly. However,
even after the pilgrims had left Mina, the Quraysh continued with
their inquiry689 to conclude that after all the oath-taking seemed to
have taken place."
Some reports suggest that they went out pursuing the people. But
they couldn't get hold of any but Sa'd bin 'Ubadah and Mundhir bin
'Amr. Of the two, Mundhir escaped but Sa'd was caught. They took
him back to Makkah in chains, pulling him by his hair and fisting him
until Jubayr bin Mut'im and Harith bin Harb came to his rescue. Sa'd
used to provide them security when their caravans passed by
Madinah, heading to, or coming back from Sham.690

688 Reported by Ibn Ishaq through a Hasan chain as a Hadith of Ka'b bin Malik
in the story of the second Pledge of 'Aqabah — Ibn Hishdm (2/101-102).

689 That is, they exhausted all means of investigation.
690 Ka'b's narration, same source (2/101-104), and it seems that Dr. 'Awdah
was mistaken when he said that the story of capturing Sa'd and Mundhir
is of a Disconnected (Mursal) chain. Perhaps he judged it in the light of
the chain that is specific to 'Abdullah bin Ubaiy bin Salul having no
knowledge of the issue at 'Aqabah. According to us it was a casual story
that came during the narration of Ka'b which goes with a Connected
(Muttasil) chain. See: the Sirat in the Sahihayn; in Ibn Ishaq, p. 362; and Ibn
Hishdm (2/103).

Lessons and Conclusions

This pledge had both short and long-term consequences. Of the
short-term consequences, some are as follows:
1.

The Ansar had realized that their support of the Prophet jl; would
win them the enmity of his enemies not excluding the Jews and
Christians. They knew it would lead to Jihad although the articles
of the pledge did not mention in explicit terms the removal of
anyone who stood up in arm in the way of Islamic propagation.

2.

The pagan effort to get hold of the Madinan Muslims upon
hearing that they proposed to help and support the Prophet
demonstrates the enmity of the pagans and disbelievers
towards truth at all times.

3.

The secrecy employed in this affair, and in other situations is to
demonstrate the legality of such means of precaution, especially
when they are affairs that affect the future of the mission.

4.

This pledge was the basis on which the Muslims and the
Prophet 3H himself emigrated to Madinah.

5.

When Islam became stronger in Madinah, those who were
concealing their faith began to reveal it.

6.

The Makkan heathens tightened their noose around the Makkan
Muslims when they realized the danger in the Prophet's contacts
with the Madinan Muslims. This tightening of the noose also led
the Prophet |g to allow the Muslims to emigrate to Madinah.

7.

As for the long-term consequences, this pledge became the basis
on which the Islamic state was established in Madinah and its
expansion from there to all corners of the world was
achieved.691

8.

In view of the importance of the pledge and the short and long¬
term consequences, those who participated in it, and in the one
before it, acquired great importance no lesser than those who

fought at Badr or those who migrated twice —once to Abyssinia
and a second time to Madinah and those who participated in the
Ridwan Pledge.
9.

Shay tan's enmity of the truth and his pain at the rise of the star
of Islam is quite apparent. He was always expected to incite the
enemies of Islam against the Prophet -|g and the people of
Madinah.

10. The 'Aqabah pledge laid the foundations for the projects that
were to be executed later at Madinah after Hijrah. Foremost
among them was Jihad and defense of the Faith. That was a
religious commandment for all times, even if Allah had not
allowed it in Makkah. However, Allah seemed to have inspired
in the Prophet
that such an action would be soon required. In
evidence we can quote the Prophet's words: when 'Abbas bin
'Ubadah asked his leave to begin the fight in Mina itself, he
replied, "We haven't been ordered that yet."
There is a consensus that the first Verse allowing the Muslims to
fight was that of Surat Al-Hajj. It said.

£ a &

Ci$i oil

"Permitted are those who have been attacked. And surely Allah is
capable of helping them."692
This Verse was revealed when Abu Bakr
showed his
displeasure when the Makkans exiled their Prophet gg and said,
"They have exiled their Prophet-we belong to Allah and to Him
we return. Surely, they will be destroyed." When the Verse was
actually revealed, Abu Bakr ^ remarked, "I knew that there is
going to be some fighting.
692 Surat Al-Hajj: 39.

693 Nasa'i reported in his Sunan (2/52), as well as At-Tirmidhi (4/151) as a
narration of Ibn 'Abbas 4, and said: "The Hadith is Hasan." However,
Albani said in the Sahih Sunan of Tirmidhi (3/79/H. 3397) that the
tradition is Sahih; Ahmad in Al-Musnad (3/262/Shakir) being a Hadith of
Ibn 'Abbas about which Shakir said that its chain is Sahih; Ibn Kathir in
his Tafsir (5/430-431); as well as Tabari in his Tafsir (17/123).

290

The Prophet of Islam

11. Allah's mercy demanded that fighting should not be prescribed
for the believers until they had found a state in which they
could find refuge. Madinah was the first such Islamic state.694
This is one aspect. Another is that they were not ordered to fight
until they had received a training that would qualify them to
fight in Allah's path.
12. From this we know that the legality of Jihad was declared after
Hijrah alone and not as Ibn Ishaq695 understands, from the day
of the second pledge at 'Aqabah.696

Note:
Ibn Ishaq697 has recorded through a chain not quite untrust¬
worthy, that Bara' bin Ma'rur
came to Makkah to participate in
the pledge at 'Aqabah. During his journey, he had prayed facing the
Ka'bah. When he met the Prophet ig, he told him, "O Messenger of
Allah. I took up this journey as a Muslim. I felt that I should not
show my back to Makkah and so prayed facing it. But my
companions censured me until I have become uncomfortable with it.
So what do you have to say?" The Prophet ^ told him, "I am on a
Qiblah. I wish you could remain on it." So Bara' returned to the
Qiblah of the Prophet #| and began to pray facing towards Sham.
The above means that the first in Islam to pray facing towards
the Ka'bah was Al-Bara'.

694 See: Buti: Fiqhus-Sirah, p. 133.

6>;'Ibn Hisham (2/92-94). Hakim reported it in Al-Mustadrak and said: “This
report is Sahib, meeting with the condition of the Shaykhan although they
did not trace and record it," and Dhahabi agreed to it.
696 Ibn Hisham (2/108) through a Hasan li Dhdtihi chain.
697 See Buti: Fiqhus-Sirah, p. 132 and Abu Shahbah: As-Siratun-Nabawiyyah (1/
454) who remarked, “This happens to be one of the erroneous impressions
of Ibn Ishaq."

Chapter

2

Emigration to Madinah

Reasons of Hijrah

(i) Persecution

From the day the Prophet % announced his mission, he and
those who had believed in him began to face a variety of difficulties
and oppressive measures. We have given a few details in an earlier
chapter. When things became too difficult for him, the Prophet #§
was forced to look beyond Makkah for help and support of his
cause. It resulted firstly in his Companions taking up the Hijrah
journey (emigration) to Abyssinia and, secondly, in efforts of his
own Hijrah to Ta if and finally, Hijrah to Madinah.
What confirms that trials and persecutions were the cause of
emigration is BilaFs following words which he said when he was
leaving Makkah, "... O Allah, curse Shaybah bin Rabi'ah, 'Utbah bin
Rabi'ah and Umaiyah bin Khalaf in retaliation of these people
expelling us from our land to the land of diseases... (He said that
because most people who went to Madinah fell sick in their early
days — Translator.)1
We can also quote the words of 'Aishah
i

Al-Bukhari/Al-Fath (18/232/H. 1889).

The Prophet of Islam

father's reasons to emigrate to Madinah: "When tortures became
unmanageable for Abu Bakr, he sought the Prophet's leave to
emigrate."2 That was also the reason why he had earlier wished to
migrate to Abyssinia along with the rest of the believers. She said
about it, "...When the Muslims faced persecutions, Abu Bakr left
Makkah seeking to emigrate to Abyssinia..."3
Ibn Ishaq indeed mentions persecution of the Muslims as the
only reason for emigration.

(ii) Availability of Support allows the Mission to move
The above can be deduced from the articles of the second
pledge at 'Aqabah, as reported by Imam Ahmad through Jabir, by
Ibn Ishaq,4 as well as others.5

(iii) Denial by the Quraysh Elite
Denial by eminent men of Quraysh, and, following them, the
great majority of their common folk, forced the Prophet

to seek

another people who testified to his mission. Sa'd bin Mu'adh
worded it accurately when he said, "O Allah, You are aware that no
one is dearer to me for a fight against, than those who gave a lie to
Your Messenger and exiled him..." According to a second version,
"...than a people who gave a lie to Your Prophet and expelled himof the Quraysh."6
Ibn Ishaq7 writes that of the several causes that led to the
Prophet's emigration, Quraysh's denial was one.

293

Emigration to Madinah

(iv) Fear of Religious Ordeal (Fitnah)

This is apparent from 'Aishah's words who, when asked about
emigration, said, "The situation with the believers was such that one
of them would seek refuge for his religion with Allah and His
Messenger, fearing that he might be tried thereof..."8
Ibn Ishaq said, "The Quraysh harassed those of the Compa¬
nions of the Prophet, and persecuted them for their religion until
they forced them out of their homes. Thus some were put to test
because of their religion, some others were (persistently) tortured
for their faith, while others ran away from their lands, escaping
them..."

(v) Permission to Fight Back

This has been mentioned by Ibn Ishaq.9 He said that the
Verse:

i

dy-XU ^

"Those who have been fought are being allowed, for that they
were wronged..."10
was revealed as the first Verse allowing the Muslims to retaliate
against those who fought them. Ibn 'Abbas 4&* 11 has the same
opinion, with a few others following him. Nonetheless, the believers
were seeking nothing but Allah's approval, bearing in His cause all
the physical and mental tortures they had to undergo, including

8
9

Al-Bukhari/Al-Fath (15/81-82/H. 3900).
Ibn Hisham (2/121) mentioning it as a report of 'Urwah and others of the
scholars.

10 Surat Al-Hajj: 39-41.
11 Ibn Jawzi mentioned in Zadul-Masir (5/436) that Ibn Abbas said. The
polytheists of Makkah used to persecute the Companions of the Prophet
i§ and he would tell them: "Be patient, for I have not been ordered to
fight." That remained until he migrated. Then Allah sent down this Verse,
and it was the first Verse that was revealed sanctioning retaliation. See
Al-Musnad (262/H. 1865). Shakir said that its chain is Sahih; and Tafsir Ibn
Kathir (5/430-431).

The Prophet of Islam

294

separation from their wives, children and other dear ones.
It was in reference to this that Khabbab bin Aratt remarked,
"We emigrated with Allah's Messenger seeking Allah's approval
and hence our rewards became due on Him..."12
There are many Ahadith (traditions) that speak of the merits of
emigration13 in the way of Allah, and the merits of those who
emigrate. For, Islam will not be established without a structure
supporting it and a State cannot be imagined without a piece of land
where it is established with a sizable number of people who listen
to, and obey the authorities who manage it.
Bukhari14 reports on the authority of' Aishah ^ that the Prophet
HI told the Muslims in Makkah: "I was shown a vision of your place
of emigration as a date-palm orchard between two lava tracts." "So,
continues 'Aishah, "those who could migrate, migrated to Madinah
directly, while most of those who had gone to Abyssinia, came back
to it."

Permission granted for Hijrah
The First Emigrants

Bukhari15 writes that the first emigrants to Madinah were
Mus'ab bin 'Umayr and 'Abdullah bin Umm Maktum. Whereas Ibn

12 Al-Bukhdri/Al-Fath (6/172/H. 1276).
13 See for example: Sahih Muslim (3/1488/H. 1865). It is the Hadith where a
Bedouin asked the Prophet sg about Hijrah and the Prophet *g told him,
"Woe unto you man. Hijrah is a tough thing." And Al-Bukhdri/Al-Fath (14/
141/The Book of Fadailus-Sahdbah).

14 Al-Fath (15/88/H. 3905). Ahmad reported it (6/198) and Ibn Sa'd in AtTabaqdt (1/226) with some difference in the wording. It can be noted that
some narrations call Ibn Maktum 'Abdullah and others call him 'Amr. See
Dhahabi: Sirat, p. 315, that is because people of Madinah said Iris name
was 'Abdullah while the people of Iraq said his name was 'Amr. This was
stated by Ibn Sa'd and others, as told of them by Ibn Hajar in the
biography of 'Amr bin Umm Maktum in Isabah (2/523).
15

Al-Fath (15/118/H. 3924-3925).

Emigration to Madinah

295

Ishaq16 and Ibn Sa'd17 believe it was Abu Salamah bin'Abdul-Asad.
This is also Musa bin 'Uqbah's opinion.18 Ibn Hajar19 believes the
two reports can be reconciled by saying that Abu Salamah had
initially intended only a few days sojourn into Madinah in contrast
to Mus'ab who had migrated for good in order to teach the new
Muslims the Qur'an, as ordered by the Prophet

Hijrah Ordeals

Umm Salamah has mentioned that when her husband Abu
Salamah decided on the Hijrah journey, he wished to carry his wife
and child along. When her people got wind of it, they caught up with
him. They told him that they were not going to allow him to take their
woman with him. So, they separated her from him. Then came Abu
Salamah's own tribal people. They said they wouldn't allow the child
to go with Abu Salamah if his wife was not allowed to travel with him.
So, they took away the child. Abu Salamah alone was allowed to
proceed. So, having lost her husband and child, Umm Salamah used
to go up to a place called Abtah, and weep there until the evening.
That went on for over a year. Finally, one of her tribesmen softened.
He said to his tribesmen, "Won't you release this poor woman whom
you have separated from her husband and child? They told her, If
you wish to join your husband, you can go." She promptly collected
her child from Abu Salamah's people and migrated to Madinah in the
company of 'Uthman bin Abu Talhah.20
When Suhayb wished to migrate, the Makkans told him, "You
came to us a pauper. You earned all your wealth here to be as well
off as you are now. Do you now intend to leave with all your

Prophet's Hijrah through a Hasan chain.

wealth? Well, we will not allow that to happen." Suhayb asked
them, "How about if I gave you my wealth? Will you then let me
go?" They agreed and he gave away his wealth to them. When the
Prophet 3§j came to know, he remarked, "Suhayb struck a good
deal."21 According to a second report, when they tried to prevent
him, he asked them, "Would you be interested in some gold in
return of my journey out?" When they said yes, he told them to dig
under the door-threshold; they would find gold there. (Having
given away that) he left the town and joined up with the Prophet |j§
at Quba. He remarked, "You struck a good deal! O Abu Yahya."
Then he recited the Verse:

"And, among the people are some who will sell himself off in
search of Allah's Pleasure..."22

Several reports are cited as Mus'ab bin 'Umayr being the cause
of revelation of the following Verse, "And, there are some among the
people who will sell themselves off in search of Allah's Pleasure..."
Tabari23 however notes after mentioning all that has been reported.
21 Reported by Ibn Hishdm, with a broken chain-As-Siraf (2/133). However,
Hakim reported it in Al-Mustadmk (3/389) as a continuous chain, and said it
is Sahih, meeting with the conditions set by Muslim although both of them
did not trace it. Dhahabi had no remark to make. But Albani agreed with
Hakim in the footnote in Fiqhus-Sirah of Ghazali, p. 166, and said, "It has a
supporting narration in the Hadith of Suhayb. Tabarani reported it as in the
Al-Majma' (6/60), and Bayhaqi as in Al-Biddyah wan-Nihayah (3/191). I may
add, and the Prophet's words unto him when he saw him, 'O Abu Yahya, a
profitable deal."
-Ahmad in the Fadailus-Sahabah (2/828/H. 1509, Mur sal (Disconnected)
but its narrators are trustworthy men.
-It might be understood from several narrations that Suhayb had migrated
to Madinah after the Hijrah of the Prophet #g. This is what Ibn Hajar has
confirmed in Al-Isabdh (2/195/biography no. 4104). See also Zadul-Masir and
Tafsir Ibn Kathir (1/360).
Surat Al-Baqarah: 207. The narration is in complete form in Al-Mustadrak
(3/400) which Hakim declared Sahih.
22 Tafsir At-Tabari (4/250/Shakir), see also: Zadul-Masir (1/223), and Tafsir
Ibn Kathir (1/360).

297

Emigration to Madinah

"The reports that have come about Mus'ab being the cause of
revelation cannot be rejected because we do not have any other
report saying why Allah (^g) revealed this Verse to His Messenger *|§.
However, its implication applies to anyone who acted similarly.

Ibn

Kathir24 nevertheless says after narrating all the reports, "But the
majority of scholars believe it was revealed to cover every Mujdhid in
the way of Allah..." There is no contradiction between what Tabari
and Ibn Kathir wrote, for, as we know, it is the generality of the
words that counts and not the specificity of the cause.

‘Umar’s Migration along with some Others
Ibn Ishaq25 relates from 'Umar & himself, "When we decided to
move out to Madinah, myself,

Ayyash bin Abu Rabi ah and

Hisham bin 'Asi bin Wa'il the Sahmi agreed that the three of us will
meet at Tanadub (Adat of Banu Ghifar) above the Sarif area 26 If one
of us didn't show up, it meant he was held back by his tribe. Myself
and 'Ayyash met at Tanadub but Hisham was held back, put to test
and he failed in the test."

24 At-Tafsir (1/360).
25 Ibn Hisham (2/129-131) via Hasan Isnad. Ibn Hajar treated it Sahih in AlIsdbah (3/604). It happens to be a narration of Ibn Sakan who carries the
chain of Ibn Ishaq. This indeed is the correct report concerning the Hijrah
of 'Umar 4® rather than the weak report that is popular among the people
which tells that 'Umar
openly announced his intention to migrate. It
also states that he said to the polytheists: “Whoever wishes his mother to
wail him and his wife to be widowed may meet me behind this valley.
The original report is with Ibn Athir (Usdul-Ghabah, 4/58). Albam
examined it in Difa' and ruled that it is weak.
It is also recorded by Ibn 'Asakir in Mukhtasar Tarikh Dimashq, Ibn
Mansur's abridgment (18/278), through a weak report since there are
three unknown transmitters.
26 Biladi said: "Tanadub and Adat of Bani Ghifar are but one place. Adat is a
land that holds water which eventually becomes clay, while Tanadub are
trees that grow on such a land. These trees can still be seeri ori the
northern side of Wadi Sarif besides the grave of Maimunah 4 the Mother
of the Believers. A village has sprung up on the westem sUe some
thirteen km from Makkah." See Also Muhammad Shirab: Al-Ma ahmulAthirah, article, Tanadub.

298

The Prophet of Islam

When these Verses were revealed 'Umar 4® wrote them down
and sent them to Hisham bin 'Asi. They said.

&

jif

"Say, ‘O those of My slaves who have wronged themselves, do
not despair of Allah's mercy. Surely Allah forgives all sins.
Verily, He is the Forgiving, the Merciful. And turn to your Lord
and submit to Him before the chastisement comes to you, when
you will not be helped. And follow the best of what has been sent
down to you before the chastisement comes to you in a state that
you are unaware."
r\ry

When Hisham received it, initially he couldn't follow how they
were related to him. He supplicated to Allah that He open the
meaning for him. Allah (Si) put it in his heart that they had been
revealed concerning men of his kind. So he joined up with the
Prophet ggg at Madinah.28 According to Ibn' Abdul-Barr, he migrated
only after the battle of the Ditch.
It is well established that the Prophet

used to supplicate

when he bowed down in his prayers in words, "O Allah, rescue
Walid bin Walid, Salamah bin Hisham and 'Ayyash bin Rabi'ah."29

Surat Az-Zumar: 53-55. See Ibn Hisham (2/129-131) it being a report of Ibn
Ishaq through a Hasan chain.
28 This authentic report contradicts the weak report that Ibn Hisham reported
in the Sirat (2/131-132) but Mu'allaq (Suspended). It speaks that Walid bin
Walid arrived at Makkah in disguise following the Prophet's desire. He
was able to learn the place where 'Ayyash and Hisham bin 'Asi were
detained. He set them free, and carried them on his camel back to
Madinah.
Al-Bukhari/Al-Fath (17/87-88/H. 4560). 'Ayyash has pointed to something
that has been mentioned in a trustworthy report of Ibn Ishaq which says
that Abu Jahl and Harith bin Hisham being cousins of 'Ayyash through
the mother's side, went to to Madinah. They told him, "Your mother has

Emigration to Madinah

299

According to other reports he added the words, "... O Allah, rescue
the weak believers../'30
As regards Abu Bakr 4b, once he too made up his mind to leave,
but the Prophet #1 prevented him saying that he could accompany
him when he himself was allowed to migrate. So he began
preparing himself for that day, buying two mounts and feeding
them for about four months,31
Hakim32 has a report according to which the Prophet m asked
Jibril, "Who'll accompany me in my journey?" He replied, "Abu
Bakr Siddiq."
Small Muslim caravans began to roll out to the Hijrah
destination. Madinah became Darul-lslam, and, with the last Muslim
soul leaving Makkah, that city became Darul-Kufr and Darul-Harb.
None of the Muslims remained there except someone overpowered
by the disbelievers, or someone who had some very good reason for
not moving out.
The last to leave was 'Abdullah bin Jahsh. He had lost his
eyesight. When he decided to leave, his wife began to create
problems. Finally she suggested that he migrate to a place other
than Madinah. Ultimately he sold his house to Abu Sufyan and
moved out secretly heading for Madinah. After he had left, Abu
Jahal, 'Utbah, Shaybah, the two sons of Rabi'ah, 'Abbas bin 'AbdulMuttalib and Huwaytib bin 'Abdul-'Uzza happened to pass by the
house. It bore signs of ruin. 'Utbah's eyes were filled with tears. He
recited a poetical piece of his own that said,

Every house, however long its life,
Will one day meet with its destruction.
vowed that the comb will not tough her head nor shall she leave the sun
until she sees you." So he decided to return to Makkah despite 'Umar
warning him that it was^a trap. That is how it happened to be. Abu Jahl
acted treacherously on the way. They took him to Makkah bound and put
him to trial. See Al-Bukhari/Al-Fath (17/87-88).
30 Al-Bukhari/Al-Fath (12/65/H. 2932).
31 See: Al-Bukhari/Al-Fath (15/88/H. 3905).
32 Reported by Hakim through 'Ali
Al-Mustadrak (3/5) and said that this
Hadith has a trustworthy text as well as chain, although the two did not
trace it. Dhahabi said, "Sahih-Gharib (Sound & Unfamiliar)."

Abu Jahl turned to 'Abbas and said, "This is what you people
have brought on us."33 (He meant Banu Hashim).
Ibn Ishaq34 has reported this incident, it being similar to the one
in Haythami. But, according to him, the blind person involved was
'Abd bin Jahsh. His nickname was Abu Ahmad being a brother of
'Abdullah bin Jahsh. His wife was Far'ah, Abu Sufyan's daughter. It
is said that it is his brother who took him along with him when he
migrated. In all likeliness, Ibn Ishaq's report is more reliable. Ibn
Hajar35 has also mentioned it, but no one else.
This incident leads us to believe that many houses in Makkah
were left in ruins.

The Prophet’s Hijrah to Madinah
(i) Quraysh Consultations
When the news leaked concerning the agreement between the
Prophet m and the Ansar at 'Aqabah, and when the Quraysh could
see that the Muslims had begun migrating to Madinah, as singles
and groups, they became apprehensive that they will gather
strength at Madinah. And, if the Prophet #§ also migrated to it
and gave them the lead in his struggle against them, then things
could get difficult for them. Therefore, they decided that they should
once and for all get rid of this source of trouble for them.
It was a Thursday, 26th of Safar, in the fourteenth year after the
Commissioning 1 (being equivalent of 12th of September of the year
622 AC) that is, some two and a half months after the second pledge
at 'Aqabah.37 The Quraysh assembled in the Nadwah House to
discuss the best way of doing away with the Prophet
33 Haythami mentioned it in Al-Majma' (6/63-64) and ascribed it to Tabarani
and added: “It includes 'Abdullah bin Shabib who was weak."
34 Ibn Hisham (2/124-125) a Mu'allaq (Suspended) report, and so weak.
35 Al-Isabah (4/3) in the biography of Abu Ahmad bin Jahsh.
36 Mentioned by Mubarakpuri, p. 176, and said in the footnote: “We used
this date after looking into the investigations carried out by Mansurpuri in
his book Rahmatul-lil-'Alamin (1/95, 97, 102; 2/471).
37 For, the Great Pledge of 'Aqabah was in June 622 as mentioned by
Mubarakpuri, p. 164. As regards two month and a half, this could be

"When those who had disbelieved were planning against you so
that they might imprison you, murder you or exile you. They
were scheming and Allah was scheming. And surely Allah is the
best of those who scheme."38
Traditions and historical records give us details of the above
abstract Qur'anic words. And, in addition to what Ibn 'Abbas has said as
the cause of revelation of the above Qur'anic Verse, there is another
report coming from him preserved with Ibn Ishaq,39 that gives us a few
more details of the proceedings of the consultative council at Nadwah.

derived from Ibn Lahiy'ah who quoted Abul-Aswad, and he 'Urwah. See:
Urwah's Maghazi, p. 128.
38 Surat Al-Anfal: 30.
Imam Ahmad reported using his own chain that this Verse was revealed
in this connection and mentioned the story (Al-Musnad: 5/87). Shakir
however said that the chain is dubious because of the presence of 'Uthman
Jazari. This Hadith was also mentioned by Ibn Kathir in his Tafsir (4/49)
regarding this situation. It can also be found in Majma'uz-Zawa'id (7/27)
with an attribution to Tabarani. He added, "It has 'Uthman bin 'Amr
Jazari who was trusted by Ibn Hibban but others thought him weak.
Other narrators are men accepted in Sahih reports." He also attributed it
to Ad-Durrul-Manthur (3/179), as well as to 'Abdur-Razzaq, 'Abd bin
Humayd, Ibn Mundhir, Abu Shaykh, Ibn Marduwayh, Abu Nu'aym in his
Dalail and Khatib. Ibn Kathir said in Al-Biddyah (3/199), "This carries a
Hasan (Good) chain and it is the best that has been reported in connection
with the spider's net over the cave's mouth..." Ibn Hajar too regarded in
Al-Fath (15/90) the Hadith as Hasan. 'Urwah also mentioned that this Verse
was revealed in this connection. See 'Urwah's Maghazi. Bayhaqi also
quoted it in his Dalail (2/465-466) as a Hadith of Ibn Lahiy'ah and
Muhammad bin Fulayh, through Abul-Aswad, ending with 'Urwah, that
the Verse was revealed in this connection.
39 Ibn Hisham (2/136-139), who emphasized its hearing, yet with a Munqati'
(Interrupted) chain, since he did not mention whom did he hear from;
whereas Tabari reported it with a Muttasil (Connected) chain in his Tdrikh
(2/370-372) thereby it acquires the status of Hasan. As regards to what

That report says that when they gathered together to discuss the
issue concerning action against

Iblis

(Satan)

appeared in an old man's form. He claimed that he was a visitor
from Najd,40 had heard of their meeting to sort out the issue and
wished to participate. They said he could.
When the proceedings started and one of the participants
suggested that they should imprison the Prophet j|| the Najdi
Shaykh interrupted, saying, "By God. That's not my opinion. If you
locked him up behind a door, it is feared that his Companions will
jump on you one fine day and free him from your hands. Thereafter,
they will increase in number and overcome you in the affair..."
Another man suggested that he be expelled. The Najdi again
broke in to say that with the sweet tongue that he possessed and the
logic he employed, the Prophet #| would enchant the hearts,
attracting the masses to himself. Ultimately, he would overcome the
Quraysh. Finally, they agreed unanimously that every tribe should
nominate a young man, of noble lineage, well placed among them.
Every one of them should be given a sharp sword. They should

took place in Darun-Nadwah, and the presence of Iblis in the form of a
Najdi Shaykh, Zuhri reported it in his Al-Maghazi, p. 100, as well as Sa'eed
bin Yahya Umawi, he from his father as Dhahabi in his Sir at, p. 317; and
Ibn Sa'd (1/227) on the authority of Waqidi.
'Urjun said in his book Muhammad Rasulullah (2/498): "The story of Iblis
appearing in the form of a Shaykh from Najd is a kind of imagination and
madness, for no trustworthy report coming from the Prophet has
confirmed it. The best that has come is from a Mursal report of Ibn 'Abbas
which does not have a reliable chain that could be relied upon and
trusted." I would like to add that the story came through a genuine chain
from Ibn Ishaq and Tabari. In addition Ibn Ishaq, Zuhri, Waqidi, Ibn Sa'd
and Umawi are all expert biographers and war chroniclers. And they all
agreed to mention this story which proves that it has a basis. If we
removed the Najdi's mention, then the story has been reported in
trustworthy reports such as those that have been mentioned in connection
with the revelation of Verse, "When those who had disbelieved were planning
against you..."
40 Suhayli mentioned in his book Ar-Rawd (2/229), that he claimed to be soand-so because they said that no one from Tihamah should share in the
consultation, for they have a soft corner for the Prophet ;g§.

divide the responsibility on every tribe. Banu 'Abd Manaf wouldn't
be able to fight all of them and will scale down their demand to
blood money.
The Najdi supported this opinion and the rest also agreed. They
dispersed over this as the plan of action.41

(ii) Permission to Migrate—Planning and the Execution
Once the Quraysh had reached the agreement by common
consent that the Prophet- #| was to be done away with, Jibril
informed the Prophet 3f| about it. He told him not to sleep in his bed
that night rather, leave the town.
Bukhari42 and Tabari43 have reproduced the report from Ibn

41 Reports do not specify the time of the meeting, whether it was at night or by
the day. We also did not come across the time that elapsed between taking
of the decision and then carrying it out. We could not also establish the time
it took between the Prophet's visit to Abu Bakr's house and the meeting of
Quraysh and the decision to kill him. We are inclined to believe from the
circumstances that there must have been the lapse of a certain period
between the two incidents. This was the period during which the selection
of the young men that were to take the action was made; and that there was
a time gap between the visit of the Prophet ^ to Abu Bakr and the 4® time
they left for the Hijrah journey. For, the plan that the Prophet
laid down
along with Abu Bakr & for successful emigration, and especially the
agreement to meet with the guide, required a short time.
42 Al-Fath (15/88/H. 3905). The story by Ibn Ishaq is without a chain - Ibn
Hisham (2/140); Imam Ahmad reported in his Musnad (5/25/Shakir) and
also Hakim in Al-Mustadrak (3/4) through a chain that he declared
trustworthy. Dhahabi agreed with him that Abu Bakr
came to the
house of the Prophet
and found 'Ali 4* sleeping in his bed. He thought
him to be the Prophet #|. 'Ali told him that the Prophet #§ had left for the
Maymun Well. Abu Bakr met him and they both repaired to the cave. It is
possible to reconcile this report with that of Bukhari by saying that the
Prophet
visiting Abu Bakr & was at noon time on the day the pagans
surrounded his house by night, so Abu Bakr went in and didn't find him.
He caught up with hifn at the Maymun Well after 'Ali 4® had told him
where he was gone, from where they both went to the cave. This was the
explanation of 'Awdah, p. 403.
43 Tdrikh of Tabari (2/377-379) through a Hasan chain.

The Prophet of Islam

304

Ishaq that when the Prophet #| was ordered to migrate, he appeared
at Abu Bakr's house with his face covered, at a time he was not used
to visiting, right at the peak of noon, when the heat is at its highest,
trapping people within the confines of their homes. When Abu
Bakr 4* was told about the Prophet m, approaching the house, he
immediately realized that his coming at that hour, in that state, held
a message of consequence.
After he was led in, the Prophet s|g asked that everyone in the
hearing range be removed. Abu Bakr 4« told him that there was no
one around but his own family. The Prophet

informed him that

Allah (M) had allowed him to migrate and that Abu Bakr was to
accompany him confirming what he had already said earlier in
indirect terms. Abu Bakr offered him one of the two camels that he
had prepared for this expedition. The Prophet ^ accepted the offer,
but insisted on paying the price.
When Abu Bakr 4* said that there was none around except his
family, he meant 'Aishah and Asma'. They both were Muslims. In
addition, 'Aishah 4 was already married to him. Therefore, there
was no fear from the two. Musa bin 'Uqbah has emphasized on this
meaning when he reported that the Prophet ^ said on that occasion,
"Send away whoever is with you." Abu Bakr replied, "There are no
eve-droppers around, only my two daughters.

According to

another report from Ibn Shihab, 'Aishah 4 said, "Abu Bakr didn t
have anyone around except myself and Asma'."44
The two then sat down to chart out a plan to defy the pagans'
plan. If we follow the reports of Bukhari and Ibn Ishaq,45 the plan
ran as follows:
1.

They were to leave their houses by night and repair to the Thawr
Cave which lay in the south-western direction46 This was to
mislead the disbelievers since their searching eyes would have

44 Ibn Hajar mentioned it in Al-Fath (15/88-89).
45 Ibn Hisham (2/142) via a chain in which he kept back the name of the one
who narrated him. Others in the chain are reliable. Tabari stated the
complete chain in his Tarikh, as a narration of Ibn Ishaq through a Hasan
chain (2/378).
46 Al-Bukhari/Al-Fath (15/90/H. 3905).

Emigration to Madinah

305

scanned the area north of Makkah in which direction lay Madinah.
2.

They were to stay in the cave for three days47 until the heat of
the chase was off.

3.

They were to hire the services of an expert guide who knew the
way to Madinah through untrodden desert tracks. The man
chosen was 'Abdullah bin 'Urqud (or Arqad) Dayli.48 He was
an idolater. He was kept in the dark over the affair, merely
asked to come and pick them up from near the Thawr Cave
after three days. The two camels that Abu Bakr ^ had prepared
for the expected journey were handed over to him.49

4.

Asma' ^ prepared the provisions for them bundling them up in
a small sack. She tore her girdle into two to tie up its neck. Thus
her nick-name thereafter "the girdled one."50 Some reports
suggest she was called "the twin-girdled one", or "the twinbelted one" (Dhatun-Nitaqayn).51

5.

Abu Bakr's son 'Abdullah was required to gather the news for
them during the day and report to them by the night at Thawr. He
returned to the town by morning to mingle with the Quraysh.52

47 Ibid; and Tabari in his Tarikh (3/378) following a Hasan narration of Ibn Ishaq.
48 That is how it is in the original manuscript of Sirat Ibn Hisham, but in the
printed copy it is Urayqit. Maybe the alteration occurred during print.
This is Dr. Sulayman 'Awdah's opinion, p. 407, f.n. With the biographers
it is 'Urayqit alone. I may point out that in the printed copy of Tabari it is
written as Urqud. See it at (2/380) as a Hasan report of Ibn Ishaq. The
verifier of As-Siratush-Shdmiyah (3/346/footnotes) said that in the manu¬
script also it is written as Urqud.
49 Al-Bukhari/Al-Fath (51/92-93/H. 3905).
50 This Hadith was reported by Al-Bukhdri/Al-Fath 15/90/H. 3905) on the
authority of 'Aishah
narrating the Hijrah story.
51 Ibid, (16/103/H. 3907), on the authority of Asma' A- Ibn Sa'd (1/299)
mentioned that Asma' split her waist-band into two. With one piece she
tied the skin bag and with the other the pitcher and so was called the one
of two waist bands. ThisAvas Waqidi's report. Ibn Ishaq and Ibn Hisham
also mentioned the reason for this naming—Ibn Hisham (2/144), both
without a chain of transmission.
52 Al-Bukhdri/Al-Fath (15/92/H. 3905), and Ibn Ishaq without a chain-lbn
Hisham (2/143).

Abu Bakr's freed slave 'Amir bin Fuhairah was to graze his
sheep around the cave during the day, supply them with milk
by night, and, incidentally remove the traces and footmarks in
the sand left by Abu Bakr's son 'Abdullah. He was also to
slaughter a sheep to feed them.

7.

By night Asma' A- was to bring them food everyday.5'

8.

Before starting, the Prophet 3^5 went up to 'Ali

and told him

to remain in Makkah behind him. He also handed over the
people's trusts. There wasn't a man in Makkah who feared his
savings but handed it over to the Prophet & for safe-keeping.
They had good experience of his honesty and trustworthiness.'1
9.

He also ordered 'Ali 4* to sleep in his bed using his usual green
Hadrami blanket. This was also to mislead the pagans.

1 le

assured 'Ali however, that no harm will touch him.
10. 'Amir bin Fuhayrah was also ordered to accompany the two to
serve them during the journey.5'1
The Prophet #5 was directed to undertake the Hijrah after he
had stayed 13 years in Makkah from the time the first revelation had
come to him.57 A Verse that came down those days was:
53 Al-Bukhdri/Al-Fath (15/91-92/H. 3905), lbn Ishaq without a chain-ftw
Hishdm (2/143).
54 lbn Ishaq without a chain—lbn Hishdm (2/142) but Tabari reported it with
a Connected (Muttasil) chain in his Tdrikh (2/378), and if consider the
words "what reached me" then, especially from him whom the Prophet
iig taught, then we might treat the report as Hasan.
55 Ahmad reported through a Hasan chain that 'Ali 4» slept in the bed of the
Prophet sfe that night, but no more: Al-Musnad (5/87/Shakir). Hakim
mentioned in Al-Mustadrak (4/3) that he ('Ali) spent the night in his bed
and mentioned the dialogue between the polytheists and 'Ali 4s- when
they found him, as he slept in a style other than that of the Prophet sfe.
What we have noted here is the narration of lbn Ishaq, with an
Interrupted (Munqati') chain but it is a Hasan report because of circum¬
stantial evidences.
56 Al-Bukhdri/Al-Fath (15/93/H. 3905).
57 Al-Bukhari/Al-Fath (15/83/H. 3902), lbn Hajar said in explaining this
Hadith: This is the best that Imam Ahmad reported through Yahya bin
Sa'eed, he through Hisham bin Hassan through this chain. He said:

On the other hand, the Quraysh chose ten leaders to represent
the entire Quraysh tribe that was opposed to Islam. The next day
they were to execute the plan that had been agreed to by the night in
the .\adwah House.
However, despite knowing the Quraysh intentions, the Prophet

m didn't forget to act according to the demands of his faith,
something heroic, in fact, what some would consider a reckless act.
It is said that by night he went to the Ka'bah in 'Ali's company.
There he raised Ali over his shoulders to help him climb over the
roof of the Ka'bah in order to throw down the Quraysh deity that
was made of brass and anchored to the roof with a steel peg. While
'Ali

was doing that, the Prophet jj| was saying, "Truth has come

and falsehood has left. Surely, falsehood had to go." 'Ali was able to

"Revelation earn/; to the Prophet
at the age of forty-three, he spent ten
years at Makkah." But more correct is what Muslim has reported on the
authority of I bn 'Abbas
that the Prophet
stayed in Makkah for
fifteen years. Jbn Kathir said in Al-Bidayah wan-Nihayah (3/288) that the
Prophet7s stay in Makkah was thirteen years after revelations began, "this
is the m//r‘- accurate df the opinions." This is his remark after he brought
in for discussion various opinions. See the original for all the details.
Surat Al-Ura': 80.
' Reported by Ahmad: Al-Musnad (3/291). Shakir said its chain is Sahih
(Sound;; Tirmidhi; Sunan (8/291/The Book of Tafsir/H. 3148; where he
judged the report as Hasan Sahih (Good & Sound). Ibn Kathir quoted it in
his 7af.tr (5/223) picking -It from Al-Musnad while confirming Tirmidhi's
judgment. And Hakim in his Al-Mustadrak (3/3), where he said: "This is a
Hadith with Safzi/i (Sound) chain, although the two did not record it."
Uhahabi agreed with him. Bayhaqi also quoted it in his Sunan (vol. 9)
following the same; chain.

disengage the deity, throw it down and break it. Thereafter the two
went back without anyone noticing them. It is said that the deity
was never replaced after that.60
Although Dhahabi has cleared the above report on transmission
grounds, he doesn't think it is a sound one. Abu Ishaq Juwayni has
declared some versions of the report as weak. But, since others have
treated the narration as trustworthy, we consider the act as one of
the Prophet's miracles.
However, when the night had darkened its hue, Quraysh
nominees gathered together in front of the Prophet's house to
execute their plans. They waited for him to emerge in order to
attack. Abu Jahl was also there to encourage them and supervise the
task. Of the things he was then saying, while he made fun of the
Prophet

about

was,

"Muhammad claims that if you followed him you'll inherit the
rule of the lands of the Arabs and the non-Arabs. Then you will be
raised up after death and inherit gardens like the gardens of Jordan.
But, if you didn't follow him you will be slaughtered and then
raised up to be shoved into the Fire!"61
While they were in that state, the Prophet |g emerged. He
heard what Abu Jahal was saying. He took a handful of dust and
said, "Yes, I say that. And you will be one of them." Then he
scattered the dust on their heads but they couldn't see him. Allah
(§g) had blinded them. He was reciting the opening nine Verses of

60 Reported by Hakim in his Al-Mustadrak following different routes (2/366367 and 2/5) and said it is correct. Dhahabi said its chain is clean but not
the text. This Hadith was also recorded by Ahmad in his Musnad and by
'Abdullah in his Zawa'id on Musnad as reported in Al-Fathur-Rabbani (20/
224). Sa'ati took it from Al-Majma' that it was recorded by Ahmad, his
son, Abu Ya'la, and Bazzar. The narrators of all these reports were
trustworthy. However, Abu Ishaq Juwayni Athari considered it a weak
chain for it contains Abu Maryam Thaqafi who, to him, is unknown. See
Nasa'i: Khasais Amirul-Mu’minin 'Ali bin Abu Tdlib, with the verification of
Abu Ishaq Athari, p. 113. He has a good discussion there which one might
look into for benefit.

short at Muhammad bin Ka'b Qurazi — Ibn Hisliam (2/139).

Surat Ya-Sin which said,

"Ya-Sin. By the Wise Qur'an... (until) ...and We have covered
them so they do not see."
The Prophet left

them in that state and went his way.62

When Abu Bakr 4*

left, he was carrying with him all that he

possessed. It amounted to five to six thousand dirhams.63
While leaving for the cave, the Prophet ^ turned toward
Makkah, with all the memories of the past flashing before his eyes.
They were symbolic of his love for the city where he had spent his
life. How could he not love a city that Allah ($g) chose to place His
House in? It was here that he was declared a Messenger for the
worlds. He halted for a while and remarked, "By Allah, you are the
best of places in the world and the most beloved by Allah. Hadn't I
been expelled, I wouldn't have left (you)."64

,:2 Being a report of Ibn Ishaq without a chain — Ibn Hisham (2/143). This
report says that he left for Abu Bakr's house and slipped away from the
house of Abu Bakr through a back door and headed towards the Thawr
cave via the lower part of Makkah. This contradicts the description that
has preceded. 'Awdah has resolved the various reports in this connection,
as we mentioned earlier.
61 Imam Ahmad mentioned through a Sound (Sahili) chain the story of Abu
Bakr 4»- taking his wealth from his home and his father's conversation
with his daughter Asma'. His chain is the same as that of Ibn Ishaq. See
Al-Fathur-Rabbani (20/282-283), and Ibn Ishaq through a Fair (Hasan)
chain — Ibn Hisham (2/152); and Hakim in Al-Mustadrak (3/5-6) where he
said, "This is an authentic report on the conditions laid by Muslim
although both did not record it."
<A Reported by Tirmidhi as in Tuhfatul-Ahwadhi (10/426). He declared it as
Good, Sound & Unfamiliar (Hasan-Charib-Sahih). Albani also declared it
trustworthy in Sahili Sunan At-Tirmidhi, (3/250/H. 3083). Ibn Majah also
recorded it. See Sahih Sunan Ibn Majah by Albani (2/196). One of the
narrators 'Abdullah bin 'Adi is reported to have said: "I saw the Prophet
£* on his camel standing by the Hazwarah (a place near Makkah or
maybe the markets of Makkah). See Ibn Kathir in Al-Bidayah wal-Nihayah
(3/225-226) who says there: "There is a problem here because the Prophet
did not go to the cave riding, nor did any one see him as he went

According to another report, "How nice a town and how
beloved to me! Hadn't my people expelled me out of you, I
wouldn't go and live in another place."
As for the attackers, when a passerby saw them on wait at the
entrance of his house, he asked them what they were doing there.
When they told him that they were waiting for the Prophet jg to
emerge, he informed them that he had already left. They wouldn't
believe him. For they could see 'Ali sleeping in the cover of his
blanket and thought that it was Muhammad. They didn t know the
truth until 'Ali

rose up from the bed in the morning.6 When they

discovered the Prophet's escape, they immediately drew plans to
trace and capture him. They took the following steps:
1. They beat up 'Ali

dragged him to the Ka bah and detained

him there for some time to try and extract information concerning
J

the Prophet H§. But they got nothing out of him.

66

secretly, so, how could Ibn Adi have heard him? Perhaps these words
belong to some other context. Bayhaqi also reported it in his Dald’il (2/
518) being a report of 'Abdur-Razzaq through Ma'mar, through Zuhri,
through Abu Salamah, through Abu Hurayrah. It stops at Hazwarah.
Bayhaqi said, “This is Ma'mar's illusion, and he too was deluded who
narrated through the route of Muhammad bin 'Amr, Abu Salamah and
Abu Hurayrah. Hakim said in Al-Mustadrak after reporting it (3/7),
“Authentic by the conditions laid by the Shaykhayn (Bukhari and Muslim),
although they did not report it." And Dhahabi agreed with him.
65 Ibn Ishaq through a Disconnected (Mursal) chain-Ibn Hisham (2/139).
The gist of all that was said is that the story of the conspiracy of the
polytheists against the Prophet % and 'Ali
sleeping in his bed, gathers
strength from the following evidences:
(a) - The story has its basis in the Qur'an in words, "When those who had
disbelieverd were planning against you..." The scholars of Tafsir say the Hijrah
context was the cause of the revelation of this Verse.
(b) - It was narrated through different chains, each narration strengthening
the other.
(c) - Its popularity among the biographers and war chroniclers. See Dr.
Sa'ud's thesis: Ahadithul-Hijrah, p. 134 (of the manuscript).
66 Mubarakpuri stated this in Ar-Rahiq Al-Makhtum ascribing it to Mansurpuri's Rahmatul-lil-'Alamin. However, I could not discover the origin of the
report from the book of latter mention.

2. A few of them - including Abu Jahl - rushed to Abu Bakr's
house hoping to find him there and to treat him the way they had
treated Ali. Asma' ^ came out to tell them on inquiry that she had
no idea where her father was. Abu Jahl was so angry with the
answer that he hit her so hard that her earring fell off the ear.67
3. They placed watchdogs at every point of exit from Makkah.
4. They declared prize money equal to a man's blood money (a
hundred camels) for each of them - The Prophet
dead or alive.68

and Abu Bakr fr -

5. They hired footmark experts to trace their movements.69

To the Cave of Thawr
Bayhaqi/0 and others71 have reported that when the Prophet i§

6

Ibn Ishaq with an Interrupted (Munqati') chain—Ibn Hisham (2/245).

(,s Al-Bukhari/Al-Fath (15/93/H. 3906). Ibn Ishaq reported through a Hasan
chain—Ibn Hisham (2/152) and Tabari: Tdrikh (2/379) to the effect that the
Quraysh offered a hundred camels to anyone who would bring the
Prophet |f back to Makkah. Ibn Hajar in Al-Fath (15/93-94) reported that
the one who stated that blood money was a hundred camel was Musa bin
'Uqbah and Salih bin Kaysan in their narrations coming from Zuhri and
Tabarani via a report of Asma'; daughter of Abu Bakr. 'Urwah said in his
Maghazi, being a narration of Ibn Lahiy'ah through Abul-Aswad, through
'Urwah, "And they sent across (men) to (various) waters ordering them
and announcing for them a great reward."
69 Explaining this Hddith, (numbered 3905) Ibn Hajar said in Al-Fath (15/91),
"Waqidi mentioned that Quraysh sent two trackers after them. One of
them was Kurz bin 'Alqamah who spotted the spiderweb at the entrance
of the cave and said, 'here ends the track.' He did not name the other." It
was Abu Nu'aym who identified him in his Dalail (although I didn't find
it in the printed work), as Suraqah bin Ju'sham. Ibn Hajar also wrote in
Al-Isdbah (3/293): "Abu Sa'eed mentioned in Sharful-Mustafa that the
polytheists hired Kurz bin ^Alqamah when the Prophet
emigrated from
Makkah. 'Alqamah followed the tracks until he reached the cave of Mount
Thawr and said, "Here end the tracks and I don't know whether he
turned left or right or climbed up the mountain." Suraqah's name is
clearly mentioned by Abu Nu'aym.
70 Ad-Dala'il: (2/476).
71 Hakim reported it in Al-Mustadrak (3/6) and said that its chain is authentic

and Abu Bakr headed for the cave, Abu Bakr would walk in front of
him for a while and then at the rear for a while. When the Prophet
inquired the reason he replied, "When I think of the searching
parties, I walk behind you. And when I think of the trappers, I walk
in front of you." The Prophet |j§ asked him, "Abu Bakr. Is there
anything that you hope for yourself but not for me?" He replied,
"Yes. There isn't a thing of minor inconvenience to you that I wish is
transferred to me instead of you."
As regards the report that comes from 'Umar

to the effect

that the two left at night, that Abu Bakr sometimes walked in front
of him and sometimes behind him, that when the Prophet #| slowed
he carried him on his shoulder, that he plugged the holes in the cave
with his toes, that snakes bit him and his tears of pain fell on the
Prophet «i|, well, this report is untrustworthy. Dhahabi'2 said about
it, "It is Denounced (Munkar) both of text as well as the reporters.
Bayhaqi73 has, however, said nothing about it. Moreover, after
narrating a version coming through Yahya bin Abu Talib who said
that 'Abdur-Rahman bin Ibrahim Rasibi said ... (so-and-so) ... he
remarked that the trouble with this report is the presence of Rasibi.
He was untrustworthy, apart from the fact that we don't know him
well enough. Khatib also mentions this report but would not give it
clearance."
After citing this report from Bayhaqi, Ibn Kathir remarked,74
"The text carries some marks of incredulity." Dr. Sa'ud added after
Ibn Kathir's remark,75 "Yes. Because the chain consists of a narrator

on the conditions set by the two scholars, if not for the fact that it is
Disconnected (Mursal). Ibn Hajar also mentioned it in Al-Fath (15/91) and
stated that Baghawi also mentioned it in similar words, being a
Disconnected report of Ibn Abu Mulaykah. Ibn Hisham mentioned it
briefly (2/143), as well as Ibn Kathir in Al-Bidayah wan-Nihayah (3/197)
ascribing it to Baghawi adding, "It is a Mursal report. We have, however,
presented supporting evidences for it in our work on the life of Abu
Bakr."

called Furat bin Sa'ib who was declared a weak reporter by Abu
Hatim and Abu Zur'ah.

Abu Hatim had said, “(The man)

transmitted Denounced (Munkar) reports." Bukhari said, “He was
abandoned. He reported (Munkar) Ahadith." The above report then
is weak and incredulous.

In the Cave
When they reached' the cave Abu Bakr ^ told the Prophet s|§,
“Hold on for a while, O Messenger of Allah. Let me tidy up the
place a bit."76 So he entered first and cleaned up the place. Then he
remembered that he hadn't cleaned up one of its corners. So he
repeated, “Hold on for a while, O Messenger of Allah until I have
cleaned up the place." With those words he entered again and
cleaned up the place thoroughly." Finished with his task, he invited
him to enter.
In the meanwhile, the Quraysh began to search for him in every
direction sending words to the watering places to keep an eye open
for him for rewards. A search party in fact came up to the Thawr
cave, and climbed up the hill. They came so near that the two of
them could hear them talking. Abu Bakr showed signs of anxiety
and fear. He said, “O Messenger of Allah. If one of them simply
looks down below his feet, he'll spot us." The Prophet

replied, "O

Abu Bakr. What do you think of the two whose third is Allah?"78 It
was in reference to this that Allah 0g) revealed.

76 That is, he wanted to'make sure of the safety of the place, and its freedom
from harmful pests.
77 Reported by Bayhaqi in Dalail Al-Nubuwwah (2/476) with a Disconnected
chain (Mursal) because it stops at Ibn Sirin. We have spoken about this
earlier; Hakim in Al-Mustadrak (3/6) where he said: "This Hadith has a
trustworthy chain if it was not Disconnected (Mursal), and the two did not
trace it." Dhahabi agreed ^yith him in his Talkhis of the work.
78 Reported by Al-Bukhdri/Al-Fath (17/205/H. 4663), Al-Fath (15/117/H.
3922). The Hadith says: "If one of them should lower his eyes, he could see
us." Muslim (4/1843/H. 2381), and Ahmad (1/159/Shakir). Shakir re¬
marked: "Its chain is Sahib." Ibn Lahiy'ah also reported it through AbulAswad, he through 'Urwah in his Maghdzi, p. 129.

"If you do not help him, then (it doesn't matter because) Allah
helped him when those who had disbelieved expelled him, the
second of the two, when they were in the cave, when he was
telling his companion, 'Be not vexed. Allah is with us.'"79
Allah (M) protected the Prophet in the cave from possible
discomforts. One of the signs of Allah's help was that, as Ahmad
reported,80 when the Quraysh came up near the mountain, they

79 Surat At-Taivbah: 40.
See all the quotations and reports cited by Tabari in his Tafsir as reasons
behind revelation of this Verse (4/257-260), as verified by Shakir. And the
story as present in the Sahihayn and others, have been brought together
for the study of the cause of revelation.
80 See Al-Musnad (5/87/Shakir). Shakir said, "There is doubt in his chain,
because of 'Uthman Jazari whom Ibn Hibban trusted but others declared
him weak. The rest of the transmitters are trustworthy. It has been
attributed in Ad-Durrul-Manthur (3/179) to 'Abdur-Razzaq, 'Abd bin
Humayd, Ibn Mundhir, Abu Shaykh, Ibn Marduwayh, Abu Nu'aym in
Dalai], and Khatib..." Ibn Kathir mentioned this story in his Tdrikh (3/198199) and said about it: "This is a Hasan chain and it is one of the best
reports narrated about the spiderweb at the entrance which was out of
Allah's protection granted to his Messenger." Ibn Hajar also declared it
Hasan in Al-Fath (15/90). Albani mentioned in his Silsilah Mawdu'ah.
I would like to add that ' Abdur-Razzaq's report is in Al-Musannaf (5/389)
but broken at Miqsam and Qatadah, and sometimes reaching up to
'Aishah
Albani said in his footnote in Fiqhus-Sirah of Ghazali (p. 173)
about Ibn Kathir and Ibn Hajar ruling it Hasan: "But this evaluation needs
another look. For 'Uthman Jazari who in fact is Ibn 'Amr bin Saj, has
drawn the following remark from 'Uqayli, "His reports may not be
followed." And hence said Hafiz in At-Taqrib, "There is a weakness in
him." And, therefore, what Ibn Kathir and Ibn Hajar reported as a
narration of Hasan Basri does not strengthen it. For the latter reported
Disconnected (Mursal) versions. Further, it has Bashshar Khufaf, who is
identified as Ibn Musa, and who was not trustworthy. Bukhari said about
him, "He narrated Denounced (Munkar) reports."
It appears from the notes made by the two Arna'uts on Zad (3/52) that
they agree with Ibn Kathir and Ibn Hajar in declaring the report Hasan.

dispersed all over the place. Some of them climbed up the mountain
and came close to the cave. When they came up to it, they found that
a spider had spun its net across its mouth. This is also reported by
Hasan Busri who added that the Prophet j|| busied himself with
prayers while Abu Bakr 4* remained on watch.81
Tabarani82 has recorded that one of the pagans came quite close
to the cave. He sat down to urinate facing the cave exposing his
private parts. Involuntarily, Abu Bakr said, “O Messenger of Allah.
We will be discovered.'' He replied, “No way. Angels are covering
us up with their wings. If he had seen us, he wouldn't be doing
what he is doing."
The rest of the days in the cave were spent in peace, except that
the Prophet

injured his finger that bled a little. He recited a

couplet meaning:
“Aren't you but a finger that bled

And met with what you met in Allah's cause?"83
A few fables with reference to the stay in the cave have been
reported. The following are the more famous of them:
1. One of them is the story reported by Ibn Sa'd84 and Bazzar85

They believe that the Disconnected (Mursal) versions of Hasan Basri are
reliable, nor did they point to the weakness in Bashshar Khufaf and the
remarks of the scholars about him.
81 Ibn Kathir mentioned it in his Tarikh (3/199) ascribing it to Hafiz Abu
Bakr Ahmad bin 'Ali bin Sa'eed Qadi in Musnad Abu Bakr, and said about
it: "This is Mursal Hasan, which happens to be Good (Hasan) by itself
because of other supporting reports. It includes mention of the Prophet's
prayer in the cave."
82 Reported by Haythami in Al-Majma' (6/53-54) where he said: "It includes
Ya'qub bin Humayd bin Kasib whom Ibn Hibban and others consider as
authentic but Abu Hatim and others considered him weak. However, the
rest of the transmitters are reliable. Hafiz mentioned it in Al-Fath (15/94)
ascribing it to Tabarani without offering us a comment.
83 See: Sahib Muslim (3/1421/H. 1796). See the comment of 'Abdul-Baqi, and
Dhahabi in his Sirat, p. 322.
84 At-Tabaqdt (1/229) through 'Awn bin 'Amr Qaysi and Abu Mus'ab Makki.
85 See Kashful-Astdr (2/299-300) also through Qaysi. But Qaysi as well as
Makki are weak. Ibn Ma'in said about Qaysi, "He is worthless." Bukhari

The Prophet of Islam

to the effect that a tree grew up covering the entrance of the cave
and a spider built a nest to cover its mouth, and that Allah (4g)
ordered two doves to make their nest at the mouth of the cave. The
story also goes that two Qurayshis went as close as forty steps from
the cave. One of them saw the two doves and returned. When his
companions asked him why he hadn't entered the cave he answered
that he saw two doves at the mouth and concluded that there
couldn't be anyone inside. The Prophet jjjfc heard the conversation
and knew that Allah (SI) had saved him by the two doves.86 So he
prayed for the two and rewarded them. They flew to the Holy
House, brought out chicks there and the present-day doves of the
Holy House are their progeny.
2. Some biographers have written that when they came close to

said, ''Man of Denounced (Munkar) reports." 'Uqayli placed him among
weak narrators. See Mizanul-Ttidal (3/306). 'Uqayli said about Makki,
"Unknown (Majhul)." Dhahabi said about him, "He cannot be identified."
See Mizan (3/303) and ATLisdn (7/105). Ibn Katliir said in Al-Bidayah (3/
199): "It was reported that two doves built their nests at the entrance of
the cave. Sarsary composed a poem that describes how providence
protected the Messenger of Allah." One of the poetical verses said:
"The spider blinded his eye,
And the dove remained laying eggs at the entrance."
Hafiz Ibn 'Asakir also recorded this report in the same words, tracing it
through Yahya bin Muhammad bin Sa'eed, 'Amr bin 'Ali, 'Awn bin 'Amr,
Abu Bakr 'Amr Qaysi whom he nicknamed 'Uwayn. He said, "I was told
by Abu Mus'ab Makki," and then narrated the Hadith.
Ibn Kathir says about this Hadith, "This report is very Unfamiliar (Gharib)
through this chain." Albani said about Sa'eed in Difa', p. 18, "Sa'eed is
unknown and unknowable, nor cleared by anyone. Indeed Hafiz Ibn
Hajar that he is weak of Hadith if he is not supported by other reports."
See this report, with these weak chains, in Bayhaqi in his Dala'il (2/481482) as well as Abu Nu'aym, also in his Dala’il (2/325).
Haythami brought it in his Al-Majma' (6/51-53) and remarked, "Bazzar
recorded it but it consists of transmitters that I do not know." But the
redactor of Kashful-Astdr, 'Azami criticized him in words (2/299, f.n.),
"There is none in it unknown but Abu Mus'ab Makki."
This report tells us that the tracker was Suraqah bin Malik bin Ju'shum of
Mudlij, that is in books other than that of Bayhaqi and Abu Nu'aym, I
mean the published ones.
K<> That is blessed them through supplication.

the mountain, Abu Bakr 4® said, "If one of them looked down his
feet, he'd spot us." The Prophet §g| replied, "If they came to us
through this opening, we shall escape through that opening." Abu
Bakr looked at the other side and found that it had opened up to the
sea wherein an anchored boat was ready to sail off.87
3. It is reported in some books that Abu Bakr told his son: "Son.
If any untoward thing strikes the people, seek refuge in the same
place where I and the Prophet had concealed ourselves. Seek refuge
there, you will be fed morning and evening."88
4. It is reported that two of the pagans came up and one of them
started to urinate facing the Prophet «i|. Abu Bakr asked, "Doesn't
the man see us?" He replied, "If he could, he wouldn't have shown
his private parts to us."89
5. It is also reported that Abu Bakr

felt thirsty. The Prophet

told him, "Go to the mouth (of the cave) and drink." Abu Bakr went
up to the mouth of the cave and drank water sweeter than honey,
whiter than milk and more fragrant than musk. When he returned,
the Prophet sH remarked, "Allah ordered the angel in charge of the
springs of Paradise to run one of its streams at the mouth of the cave
for you to drink from."90

87 Ibn Kathir said in Al-Bidayah wan-Nihayah (3/201) that this is not beyond
the power of Allah. But there hasn't been a report through either a weak
or strong chain.
I would like to add that the report in question until the words "at their
feet" was reported through a trustworthy chain. See Ibn Hanbal's AlFada'il (1771/H/179). *
88 Reported by Bazzar with a chain that includes Musa bin Mutayr as in AlBidayah wan-Nihayah (3/201). Ibn Kathir said: "Musa bin Mutayr is weak
and an abandoned transmitter. He was charged with lies by Ibn Ma'in
and hence his reports may not be accepted."
Sa'ud added (p. 169): "...Abu Hatim said: Abandoned in Hadith, a
destroyer of Hadith.” See: Jarikh Ibn Ma'in (2/596) and Al-Jarhu zvat-Ta'dil
(8/162).
89 Reported by Haythami in Majma'uz-Zawa'id (6/54) and he said: "It
includes Musa bin Mutayr, and he was abandoned."
90 Reported by Suyuti in Al-Khasd'is (1/307-308), and said about it, "Ibn
'Asakir traced it through an absurd chain ending with Ibn 'Abbas."

The Prophet of Islam

318

Journey to Madinah
When the intensity of the search had somewhat subsided in
three days time, Ibn 'Urqud came up to the agreed spot leading the
two camels. 'Amir bin Fuhayrah was with them and the party took
the shoreline route.91
After taking all those precautionary measures that were
humanly possible, the Prophet

was calm and his tongue busy

with Allah's remembrance. Abu Bakr

on the other hand was on

the watch and extremely concerned for the Prophet's safety.92
When the time for the afternoon siesta arrived, they left the
main road and took shelter under a large rock that Allah

(3i) had

raised for them. Abu Bakr prepared the place for him, spread a piece
of leather and invited him to take repose while he himself remained
on the guard. And, as he took position, he found a Bedouin driving
along his cattle. He too was looking for shelter. Abu Bakr spoke to
him to find out who he was. He discovered that the man was in fact
a Makkan. He agreed however to milk one of his goats for them.
Abu Bakr instructed him to clean the udder before starting to milk
the animal. He didn't disturb the Prophet 3|§ for the drink, rather
waited until he woke up. When he had drunk to Abu Bakr's
satisfaction the Prophet ^ ordered the march to continue.93 Abu
Bakr was the pillion rider. Whenever they encountered someone
with a curious mind and asked about the Prophet, Abu Bakr would
say, "This is my guide." The inquirer took the literal meaning of a
road-guide while Abu Bakr meant spiritual guide.94

91 See Al-Bukhari/Al-Fath (15/93/H. 3905) and (14/142-143/H. 3652). Ibn
Ishaq named the places by which the Prophet |jg passed — Ibn Hisham (2/
150-156) without a chain.
92 See Al-Bukhari/Al-Fath (15/95/H. 3906).

and (14/142-144/H. 3652). A similar Hadith was reported by Ibn 'AbdulBarr in Al-lsti'ab (3/240), and ascribed it to Tayalisi, whose chain is
reliable. This was what Sa'ud said, p. 200. Dhahabi recorded it in his Sirat,
p. 330-331, as also Hakim in Al-Mustadrak (3/8) and Ahmad in Al-Musnad
(1/154-155/Shakir), and said, "Its chain is reliable, and it has some
additions."

Bukhari *' has preserved the report of Suraqah bin Malik who
belonged to Banu Mudlij.96 The little caravan passed close by their
dwellings. One of their men spotted them. He told Suraqah that he
could see dark patches moving near the seashore and strongly felt it
was

Muhammad

and

his

men.

Suraqah

said,

"I

knew

immediately that it was Muhammad and his men. But (coveting
the reward) 1 told him, 'Rather, they are so-and-so who started off a
while back right from here.7" However, after allowing a respectable
time, Suraqah got up, hurried to his house and ordered his slave-girl
to lead his horse to a spot behind a sand dune. Then he prepared
himself and slipped out to the place where the horse was waiting for
him. He jumped on it and rode off. When he came close upon
Muhammad

and his companions, his horse stumbled. So Suraqah

brought out his arrows and struck them to find out if he should
pursue them or not. The arrows told him what he did not like to be
told. But he wouldn't obey the arrows. He rode up again and chased
them until he got so close that he could hear their voices. But there
his horse's legs sank into the sand up to its knees.97 That was
followed by some smoke that rose up like a big ball. Suraqah
realized that the Prophet

was being protected from him. So he

Disconnected (Mursal) chain which includes Abu Ma'shar who is weak. It
contradicts what is in the Sahih, as he mentioned that the Prophet jg§ was
riding behind Abu Bakr 4* on his camel. Through another chain (1/235)
but trustworthy. Yet, it also contradicts what is in trustworthy reports that
describe how the Prophet
was riding. See Ahmad in Al-Fathur-Rabbani
120/290) where its chain is Sahih. Sa'ati said, "Bukhari and Ibn Ishaq
narrated it in meaning."

' Al-Fath (15/93-96/H. 3906) but Ibn Ishaq reported in a complete form
through a Hasan chain—Ibn Hishdm (2/152-154). Muslim also reported it
(4/309/H. 2009), as well as Ahmad: Al-Fathur-Rabbani (20/284-285).
Hakim in Al-Mustadrak (3/6-7) where he declared it trustworthy, and
'Abdur-Razzaq in Al-Musannaf (5/392-393).

descending down Qudayd.

Hadith of Anas with him. Same source, p. 107, H. 3911. While in the Hadith
of Bara' in Sahih Muslim (3/192/H. 2009) it is stated that it was because of
the Prophet's supplication against him.

pulled out his arrows once again to consult them. Once again they told
him to give up his evil design. So, he called out promising peace. They
stopped. He mounted his horse once again to reach them. He knew
from the way the horse's legs had sunk into the sand that the Prophet's
mission will overcome all opposition. He informed the Prophet

that

the Makkans had announced the reward of a hundred camels for him.
He also informed him about a few other things they were doing (to
capture him). He also offered them food and other provision. But they
accepted nothing from him except that the Prophet #5 told him not to
pass on to others the news about his whereabouts. Suraqah sought
that he write to him a note of peace. He ordered 'Amir bin Fuhayrah to
write down peace for him on a piece of leather. Thereafter they
continued with their march.
Bukhari98 has a report coming directly from Abu Bakr

He

said, "We journeyed while the people were in our search. But no one
was able to detect us except Suraqah bin Malik bin Ju'shum. As he
galloped towards us, I said, "This man has caught up with us, O
Messenger of Allah." He replied, "Be not vexed. Allah is with us."
When Suraqah returned to his people, he spread the word, "I
have checked on the information. Along this side, you don't have to
check."99 Thus, by morning he was chasing the two and by the
evening he had become their protector.100
Suraqah preserved that writing until he came to the Prophet
after he had finished his campaign against Ta'if and Hunayn some
eight years after the incident. He sought peace and the Prophet ^
granted him saying, "Yes. Today is the day for honoring the trust
and goodwill." It was on that day that Suraqah embraced Islam.101

Prophet ^ asked Suraqah, "How will it be when you don Kisra's
bracelets?" Accordingly, when 'Umar 4® was brought Kisra's
bracelets, girdle and crown, he asked for Suraqah and gave the
bracelets to him. Suraqah was a stocky man with thick hair on his
arms. 'Umar said, "Raise your hands." Then, as he put the bracelets
onto his hands he remarked, "Allah is Great who took them from
Kisra who used to say, 'I am the people's Lord,' and gave them to
Suraqah to wear," adding in a raised voice, "a mere Bedouin from
Banu Mudlij."
Ibn Ishaq104 has some poetry that Abu Jahl said, in which he
incited Suraqah's tribe against Suraqah. Suraqah also replied to him
with poetical composition of his own.105
Next, the Prophet
passed by the two tents of Umm Ma'bad of
Khuza'ah tribe as he moved on. They asked her if she had some
food. She complained of drought. The Prophet
spotted a goat
near the tent. He asked her about it. She said, "A goat too weak to
follow the herd." He asked if she had any milk. She replied that she
was too weak for that. He sought her permission to milk her and she
said, "If you think it will yield milk, go ahead." The Prophet 3g|
rubbed her udder and supplicated to Allah. Her udder became full
of milk. He asked for a pail and milked her. Then he offered the milk
to the woman. She drank until she was full. Then he offered the milk
to others of his companions and they drank to their fill. Finally he
himself drank. Then he milked her again until he filled the pail and

104 Being a narration of Yunus bin Bukayr without a chain. Bayhaqi
mentioned it in his Dalail (2/489) and mentioned the poetical lines of
Suraqah but not those of Abu Jahl. See the lines of Abu Jahl with the
redactor for Bayhaqi did not mention them.
105 See the lines of Suraqah and those of Abu Jahl in Al-Bidayah wan-Nihayah
by Ibn Kathir (3/204) who said: "This poetry was mentioned by Umawi
in his Maghazi through aychain of his, on the authority of Ibn Ishaq. Abu
Nu'aym also spoke of it through his own chain through Ziyad, and Ibn
Ishaq, and he added a few more Verses to those of Abu Jahl that contain
great blasphemy. See Al-Dalail by Abu Nu'aym (2/336-337) which is
similar to what Ibn Kathir said, and it relies on Ibn Ishaq as the source,
without a chain.

The Prophet of Islam

left it with Umm Ma'bad. After that they left the place.
When Abu Ma'bad, the woman's husband arrived, he was
surprised by the milk. When she informed him about the strangers
he remarked, "By God, he seems to be the man the Quraysh are
looking for." He asked her to describe him. When she did, he
remarked, "I am sure this is the Qurayshi man they are talking
about. I wish I could accompany him. I would, if I knew how to find
him."
It is said that the next day they heard a loud voice in Makkah
saying the following poetical piece, although they could not see the
person.
Ask your sister about her goat and her vessel
For, if you asked your goat, she'd tell you.106

106 Tire story of the Prophet jgj and Umm Ma'bad was reported by Hakim in
Al-Mustadrak (3/9-10) in a lengthy form being a the Hadith of Hisham bin
Hubaysh. He remarked that the Hadith had a reliable chain although the
two did not record it. He mentioned a few supporting data. Dhahabi agreed
with him and judged it trustworthy. However, he disagreed with him over
the conditions to be met for a Sahih report. He said that it is from Hisham
bin Hubaysh bin Khuwaylid, but there is an error in there. It should be
Hisham, and he through his grandfather Hubaysh. Also Khuwaylid is an
error. It should be Khalid. These facts were pointed out by Dr. 'AbdulMahdi in his lecture, published as typed copy under the name As-SiratunNabawiyyah minal-Kitdb was-Sunnah, p. 54.
The two Anma'uts said in the footnotes of Zadul-Ma'ad (3/57): "A Hasan
report that Bayhaqi reported in his Dala'il (2/491-492) as a Hadith of
Yahya bin Zakariyyah." Ibn Kathir said in Al-Bidayah wan-Nihdyah (3/211):
"A report of Hasan chain." Dr. Sa'ud followed him in his thesis on Hijrah,
p. 198, and added, "But it is broken for 'Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Layla
never met Abu Bakr..." He referred to Jami'ut-Tahsil, p. 275, and AtTahdhib (6/2600).
The contents of Bayhaqi's version are close to the contents of Hisham bin
Hubaysh and he reported it in the manner of Ibn Hubaysh, through his
own chain, reaching up Abu Ma'bad as mentioned by Ibn Kathir (3/211212) who ascribed to Suhayli, p. 111.
Ibn Kathir said in Al-Bidayah wal-Nihdyah (3/209) regarding the story of
Umm Ma'bad: "Her story is popularly known and has been reported
through different sources, supporting each other." Then he quoted the

Emigration to Madinah

323

Later, the small caravan passed by another Bedouin who was
shepherding goats. They asked him for some food. He begged
excuse explaining that there was no milk in his goats except for one
that had maybe a pint left in her. The Prophet #§ once again passed
his hand over her udder and milked her. They all drank to their full.
When the shepherd witnessed this miracle, he became a Muslim. He
wished to join them. But the Prophet sH told him to stay put until he
heard that he had overcome his enemies.107
As they advanced, they met a caravan of Muslim traders who
were returning from Sham. Zubayr was with them. He offered him
and Abu Bakr a white shawl each as gift.108

different narrations (2/209-214). Ibn Hajar in Al-Fath (15/107) mentioned a
few of the narrations, and Haythami mentioned it in Al Majma' (6/55-58)
on the authority of Hubaysh bin Khalid remarking: "Tabarani recorded it
via a chain of narrators that are unfamiliar to me. He mentioned it in the
ch. 'Alamatun-Nubuwzvah. Ibn Sa'd also reported it in his Tabaqat (1/230232) in detail, coming down from Umm Ma'bad. Bazzar reported it briefly
through a weak chain in Kashful-Astdr (2/300-301).
To summarize, the story rises to the level of Hasan li Ghayrihi because of
the numerous chains and because of its popularity as said Dr. Sa'ud in his
thesis, p. 199. Umm Ma'bad's description of the Prophet jjg| follows.
107 This story was reported by Hakim in his Al-Mustadrak (3/8) as a Hadith of
Qays bin Nu'man. Suyuti reported it in Al-Khasa'is (1/312) treating it as
Sahih ascribing it to Abu Nu'aym, Abu Layla, Tabarani, Hakim and
Bayhaqi. Ibn Kathir quoted in Al-Biddyah wan-Nihayah (3/213) this story
taking it from Bayhaqi, saying, "Abu Ya'la Mawsili narrated it. Ibn Kathir
said (in Al-Biddyah wan-Nihayah) commenting on these stories and
especially the miracle of the goat, "It is possible that all these stories are
one."

*

108 Reported by Al-Bukhdri/.Al-Fath (15/97/H. 3906). Ibn Hajar discussed
trying to reconcile between what the biographers said and what Bukhari
said in regard to this story. 1’he summary is that the report was traced by
Musa bin 'Uqbah through Zuhri and added to it his words, "It is said that
when he neared Makkah, Talhah had just arrived from Sham. He began to
return to Makkah either _fo meet him, or to perform an 'Umrah. He had
some clothes brought from Sham that he gifted to Abu Bakr. When he met
him, he gave them to him and so he and Abu Bakr wore out of them. This
however, if correct, could all be from Talhah and Zubayr gave the two the
clothes. See rest of the sayings of the biographers in Al-Fath by Ibn Hajar
(15/97).

324

The Prophet of Islam

When they reached 'Arj, they needed to ask the way. The
people there were from the tribe Aslam, and were known as

Mahandn' (the dishonored ones). The Prophet

didn't like the

name. When he reached them, he offered them Islam and they
became Muslims. He named them Mukarraman (the honored ones).
He asked them to join him up at Madinah.109
Bazzar110 and Ibn Athir* * 111 have preserved the report through
Buraydah bin Husayb of the Aslam tribe that as they advanced they
met another caravan. He asked Abu Bakr 4b to find out who they
were. They said they were of the Aslam tribe. He told him to ask of
which clan of the Aslam tribe. They replied that they were of the
Banu Sahm tribe. The Prophet ^ said, "Lay aside your arrows, O
Abu Bakr."
Then, as they arrived at Juhfah (about 30 km from Madinah)
they came across camels being pastured. He asked whose camels
they were. He was told that they belonged to a man of the Aslam
tribe. (In Arabic, Aslam means one who entered into peace). The
Prophet ii| drew the good omen: "You have entered into peace by
Allah's Will, O Abu Bakr." He asked the shepherd his name. He said
Mas'ud. (In Arabic, Mas'ud means lucky one). The Prophet
remarked to Abu Bakr, "You have attained good luck by Allah's
Will."112

109 This story was reported by 'Abdullah son of Imam Ahmad, in his Zazva'id
'Alal-Musnad (4/74). See also: Al-Fathur-Rabbdni (22/288). Sa'ati made no
comments about its chain. Haythami mentioned it in Al-Majma' (6/58)
saying: “Narrated by 'Abdullah bin Ahmad. As for Ibn Sa'd (one of the
narrators), he is identified as 'Abdullah about whom I know nothing. The
rest of the transmitters are reliable."
110 Kashful-Astar (2/301-302), Haythami said in Al-Majma' (6/55): “Narrated
by Bazzar and the chain includes 'Abdul-'Aziz who was abandoned."
111 See Usdul-Ghdbah, Dar Al-Fikr Publication. Its chain is Interrupted (Munqati').
112 Ibn Kathir reported it up to this point in Al-Biddyah wan-Nihayah (3/209)
as a narration of Abu Nu'aym, without comments.
I say, see Al-Ma‘rifah by Abu Nu'aym (2/book 182/A). This one has in its
chain Muhammad bin 'Abbad bin Musa 'Ukli. There is weakness in it.
Further, nobody ever wrote about Musa bin 'Abbad and Iyas bin Malik.
So the report is weak.

325

Emigration to Madinah

It is also said that one of the camels was left behind. When Aws
bin 'Abdur-Rahman bin 'Abdullah bin Hujr Aslami who owned
quite a few camels came up to meet them, he gave them a camel as
well as a young man Mas'ud to escort them to their destination. He
110

accompanied them up to Quba'.
According to another version, Aws bin 'Abdullah bin Hujr
Aslami passed by him and Abu Bakr at a place called Hadawat—
between Juhfah and Harsha. He found them riding a single camel
heading towards Yathrib. He gave them his own camel called Ibn
Rada' and sent with them his slave Mas'ud. Aws Aslami ordered
him to take them by the familiar route and not part company with
them until they reached their destination. Accordingly, he only
returned after taking them up to Yathrib. He brought back the
message to his master that he was to stamp the names of the camels
on their necks.114

1,3 The content of this story is found in Al-lsti'ab (1/82). Ibn Abdul-Barr said
its chain is Hasan.
114 Ibn Hisham reported in his additions to Sirat Ibn Ishaq, without offering a
chain. See: Sirat Ibn Hisham (2/156). Ibn Hajar too reported it in Al-Isabah
(1/86) under the biography of Aws bin Malik and stated that Tabarani
preserved it. He also said, "Abul-'Abbas bin Siraj also recorded it in his
Tarikh ... in Disconnected (Mursal) form." Then he said, "Ibn 'Abdul-Barr
has said (Ad-Durar, p. 91), 'He was reporting his Hadith from his son, and
it is Hasan."'
I might add that Ibn 'Abdul-Barr's declaration of just about acceptability
(Tahsin), is influenced by his treatment of Mursal Hadith as acceptable. But
the majority of Hadith scholars reject it. They have certain conditions that
must be fulfilled for* its acceptance such as, supporting evidences, and,
further their division of such reports into kinds and classes of Mursal
reports... unto the end of the discussions over this. See in this regard
books dealing with guiding principles for acceptance or rejection of Mursal
reports, or one might see some books on Principles of Hadith Criticism.
The report is also in Al-lsti'ab.
Haythami recorded in Al-JMajma' (6/55) and said: "Reported by Tabarani
but there are some in the chain whom I did not know. And Ibn Hajar
(15/107) mentioned that it was reported by Abu Sa'eed in his book
Sharful-Mustafa through Iyas bin Malik bin Aws Aslami, and Ibn Sakan,
and Tabarani reported with a full chain running through Iyas, his father,
his grandfather Aws bin 'Abdullah bin Hujr, and then reported in detail

326

The Prophet of Islam

The small caravan also came across Buraydah bin Husayb
Aslami at Ghamim. He was then the chief of his tribe. He had
actually come out in the hope of capturing them for the rewards
promised by the Quraysh. When he met with the Prophet

he

presented him the message of Islam. Moved by it, he embraced it
there and then. It is said that influenced by him more than eighty
families became Muslim.

Other reports say it was seventy

families.115 Buraydah spent the night with the Prophet 5|§. Next

almost the same words.” Ibn Hajar also said in Al-Isabauj (3/338,
biography of Malik bin Aws): "Musa bin 'Uqbah's Maghazi, on the
authority of Zuhri, that the man they passed by was Malik bin Aws, the
name of the beast was Ibn Liqah and the name of the boy Mughith.” He
also stated that Malik bin Aws and his father Aws are of the Companions.
Ibn 'Abdul-Barr said in Al-Isti'db (3/382): "According to some, he has the
honor of companionship of the Prophet
but this is questionable."
I would like to add that in the chain stated by Ibn Hajar falls Fayd bin
Wathiq about whom Ibn Ma'in said, "A dirty liar." See Diivanud-Du'afa' of
Dhahabi, p. 250, although some have considered Fayd as not too
untrustworthy.
11:1 The news of the Prophet sfe meeting with Buraydah and his embracing of
Islam with a group of his own tribesmen (is in the following books):
(a) - Imam Ahmad in his Musnad (5/346).
(b) - Ibn Sa'd (4/242), from a narration by Waqidi, he said that eighty
households embraced Islam and prayed 'Isha' with the Prophet
that
the meeting-place was Ghamim, and that the Prophet sg| taught him first
few Verses of Surat Maryam that night.
(c) - Dhahabi: Siyar A'ldmin-Nubala' (2/4690, and As-Siratun-Nabawiyyah, p.
330, through a chain with Aws bin 'Abdullah bin Buraydah but who was
abandoned. Ibn Hibban, however, treated him reliable adding that the
Denounced (Mutikar) reports are through his brother Suhayl. However,
Ibn Hibban was not so strict in judging narrators. In the Hadith it was
mentioned that seventy of his people embraced Islam together with him.
However, Ibn Athir said in Usdul-Ghabah (1/209) two reports through two
chains. First is Suspended (Mu'allay) while the second is Interrupted
(Munqati'). The first says that they were around 80 houses while the
second says they were 70 riders.
(d) - Ibn Hajar in Al-lsdbah (1/146) without chain quoting a Hadith of Ibn
Sakan. It was mentioned that he stayed in his place until Badr and Uhud
were over. It was also said that he embraced Islam after the Prophet
had left Badr.

and others have recorded

that when the Ansar came to know that the Prophet #1 had left
Makkah, they began t.o spend the mornings outside the town
waiting for him, returning only at noon when it got very hot. It was
the 12th of Rabi'ul-Awwal, a Monday, the 14th year after the
commissioning (being 23rd of September 622 the Christian Era),120
when they came out as usual. But when the day became hot, they
returned. One of the Jews climbed up the wall of his fort to attend to
some work. He spotted the Prophet ^ and his companions. He
cried out in a loud voice, "O Arabs.121 Here is your awaited man."
The Muslims took their arms and rushed out to meet him at the lava

(e) - Ibn 'Abdul-Barr in Al-Isti'ab (1/173-174) without a chain and similar
to the narration of Ibn Sa'd.
116 This part of the story of Buraydah embracing Islam was mentioned by
Diyar Bakry in Tarikhul-Khamis (1/235), which he took from Ibn Jawzi
from his book Sharful-Mustafa, through Bayhaqi reaching up to Buraydah.
See Zurqani: Sharhul-Mawahibil-Ladunniyah (1/421).
U1 Al-Fath (15/97-99/H. 2906) and (15/119/H. 3925).
118 With a weak chain, see Ibn Hisham (2/156-157).
119 Al-Mustadrak (3/11). He considered it trustworthy and Dhahabi agreed
with him pointing that it is in the Sahihayn.
120 See Ar-Rahiq Al-Makhtum, p. 190-191. He quoted it from Rahmatul-lil'Alamin (1/102), and said in the footnote: “On this day the Prophet
completed the age of fifty-three. And his mission completed thirteen years
according to those who believe that he was granted the Office on the ninth
of Rabi'ul-Awwal, 41 years after the Elephant Year. As for those who
believe that he was granted the Office in Ramadan, 41 years after the
Elephant Year, to such h£ completed on that day 12 years, 5 months and
18 or 22 days." See discussions of Ibn Hajar in Al-Fath (15/98) to all the
suggestions regarding the date of his arrival at Quba. However, popular is
Ibn Ishaq's report that it was 12th of Rabi'ul-Awwal-Ibn Hisham (2/156).

the name of one of their grandmothers — Ibn Hisham (2/157).

fields. The sounds of welcome and Allahu Akbar (Allan is the Most
Great) were heard as far away as the dwellings of 'Amr bin 'Awf.
They were shouting out Allahu Akbar in joy. They greeted the
Prophet

in the Islamic manner of greeting. Those of them who

hadn't seen

the Prophet

greeted

Abu

Bakr 4b under the

impression that he was the Prophet. It was only when the day got
hot and Abu Bakr stood up holding a piece of cloth over the Prophet
^ to shelter him, that they knew which of the two was Prophet
Muhammad $&.122 They surrounded him and at that moment the
revelation came.

"Surely, Allah is his protector, and Jibril and those of the
Muslims zuho are pious, as well as the angels, are in (his) aid."123
Women, children, slaves and servants were shouting, "Mu¬
hammad has arrived. Allah's Messenger has arrived. God is Great.
Muhammad has arrived."124 The welcoming party was singing
poetical lines:

The new moon has arisen from behind the Wada' mountains
Gratitude remains due on us, so long as a supplicant
supplicates.125

Bukhari's narration ends here.
121 Surat At-Tahrim: 4.
124 For this part see Al-Mustadrak (3/13). Hakim said: "This is a trustworthy
report according to the Shaykhayn's conditions, although they did not
transmit. Dhahabi gives us to believe that the Hadith is in the Sahihayn.
’~5Some scholars reserved their opinion regarding this song, questioning it
from the point of text as well as narration due to the phrase ThaniyyatulWada' which was known to be in the direction of Sham and not Makkah.
Ibn Hajar said in Al-Fath (15/120) that Abu Sa'eed traced it in SharfulMustafa, and we have reported in Fawaidul-Khal'i, in Interrupted (Munqati') form that, "when the Prophet
entered Madinah, young girls began
to sing:
The new moon has arisen from behind the Wada' mountains
Gratitude remains due on us, so long as a supplicant supplicates.
But that has a Faulty (Mu'dal) chain. It is possible that this singing took
place at the time he was returning from Tabuk." Bayhaqi recorded in his

They were still in the outskirts of the town. The Prophet %
continued until he reached the dwellings of Banu 'Amr bin 'Awf in
Quba. He stayed with Kulthum bin Hadm. He was of the Aws. He
stayed with him some four days. A mosque was established there in
Quba which was the first mosque ever built after he was
commissioned as a Prophet.
Then, by Allah's command, the Prophet ag£ again mounted his

behind him. He passed by Banu Najjar

who were related to him from the mother's side. They came out
with their swords in his honor. He continued to march towards
Madinah. On Friday he happened to be in the dwellings of Banu
Salim bin 'Awf. He offered the Friday prayers in the middle of the
valley in a congregation amounting to a hundred men.1"6 It was the
Prophet's first Friday prayer in Madinah.127

Dala'il (2/506-507) through a very weak chain, for, between Ibn 'Aishah
and the Prophet
Mafawiz who died in the year 228 AH._ Nevertheless,
Mubarakpuri preferred Mansurpuri's opinion (Rahmatul-lil-'Alamin 1/106),
that this song was sung when he arrived at Madinah from Makkah on the
basis that the evidences cannot be rejected. Ibn Qaiyim however does not
agree in his Zad (3/5111) with those who believe that this happened when

jjg,

he arrived from Makkah into Madinah.
On the other hand, 'Urjun wrote in his book Muhammad Rasulullah (2/602)
that the well-known song is there in Mawahibul-Lddunniyah, and that
Qastalani said in Mawahib, after citing the report of Anas: "Young girls
climbed the roofs at his arrival singing, "The new moon..." And the report
of Anas is in Abu Ddwud. 'Urjun thinks the report is trustworthy if
referring to the arrival of the Prophet m, into inner parts of Madinah, at
the house of Abu Ayyub. He reconciles the reports and discusses them in
full. And of course, it is not impossible that the song was repeated a
second time at his return from Tabuk. See 'Urjun (2/602-611). We
ourselves are inclined to 'Urjun's opinion that the singing took place twice
and that Thaniyyatul-Wada' are not in the direction of Sham alone. See
discussions of Abu Turab Zahiri over this issue: Al-Atharul-Muqtafa li
Qissati Hijratil-Mustafa j(pp. 155-162); and Sumhudi Wafa'ul-Wafa', ed.
Muhammad 'Abdul-Hamid (4/1167-1172).
126 Reported by Ibn Sa'd (2/236-237) with a Connected (Muttasil) chain and
trustworthy narrators. Ibn Ishaq reported in a Suspended (Muallaq)
form — Ibn Hisham (2/159).

The Prophet of Islam

He entered the town only after the Friday prayers in a climate
filled with joy and happiness.128 He wouldn't pass by any
neighbourhood, but they would take hold of his camel's halter
and beg him to allow them host an honored guest. He would say.
Leave her, for it is commanded." She kept marching forward, with
him mounted on her, until she arrived at the spot where the
Madinan Grand Mosque now stands. There she squatted. But he
didn't alight. After a few moments she rose up and moved forward
a little. Then she turned and came back to the old spot and settled
there for good. He came down. The place belonged to Banu Najjar,
right in front of Abu Ayyub's house. Abu Ayyub came forward, and

his building of the Mosque and settling into Ayyub's house... through a
single chain, as Bayhaqi understood in his Dala'il then we might say, "Ibn
Ishaq reported through a Hasan chain-Ibn Hisham (2/159). Bayhaqi
recorded it in his Dala il (2/512) but Ibn Ishaq did not emphasize on direct
hearing.
Ibn Hajar mentioned it in Al-Fath (15/120) that a group of Bani Najjar
girls came out playing their tambourines when the Prophet
descended
at their neighborhood. They were saying:
We are the girls of the Banu Najjar
Welcome O Muhammad, as a neighbor.
He ascribed it to Hakim through Ishaq bin Abu Talhah, through Anas. Ibn
Kathir mentioned it in Al-Bidayah wan-Nihdyah (3/219) as a narration of
Bayhaqi (2/508) through his chain reaching up to Anas (2/508) adding in
it after these lines: "The Messenger of Allah H came out and asked them:
'Do you love me?' They answered: 'By Allah, we love you, O Messenger
of Allah.' At that he said three times: 'And, by Allah, I love you too.'" Ibn
Kathir said: "This Hadith is Unfamiliar (Gharib) by this route. None of the
six canonical authors of Hadith recorded it. It is Hakim who recorded it in
his Al-Mustadrak, as it is narrated." Albani said in Di/a', p. 24, quoting his
own source, "Its weakness is in Ibn Sirmah." Bayhaqi reported in his
Dala'il (2/508) following another route reaching Anas. That report says
that they said these lines when the Messenger jgj passed by the Banu
Najjar neighborhood and that he told them, "Allah knows that my heart
loves you." He did not mention that this took place when he was coming
in from Madinah. Albani declared its chain reliable in Difa', p. 24, and
then added, "Indeed in Bukhari, Muslim and others through Anas that this
was during a ceremony, but he did not produce the lines."

took the saddle, the Prophet said, "A man is with his saddle." As'ad
bin Zurarah took charge of his camel.129
The Prophet 0 occupied the lower floor of the two-story house.
Abu Ayyub occupied the upper portion. That night Abu Ayyub
said to his wife, "Can we walk over the head of the Prophet?" So they
spent the night in one comer of the house. Next day he requested the
Prophet 0 that he better occupy the upper portion. The Prophet 0
told him, "Ground floor suits us better." Abu Ayyub said, "I won't be
up there while you are down here." So, (some time later) the Prophet
0 shifted to the upper floor1 and Abu Ayyub to the lower.
Abu Ayyub took it upon himself to prepare food for the
Prophet 0. When the tray was taken away from the Prophet 0 and
brought to Abu Ayyub, he would ask for the spot from where the
Prophet 0 had eaten and he himself ate from there. One day he
prepared something in which garlic had been used. When his turn
came he asked for the spot from where the Prophet 0 had eaten.
But he was told that the Prophet 0 hadn't eaten at all. He went up
and asked him, "Is it unlawful?" The Prophet 0 replied, "No. But I
don't like it." He said, "And I dislike what you dislike." Actually, it
was because angels visited the Prophet 0, and they don't like garlic
smell.130
Once when a water pitcher broke, at a time when Abu Ayyub was
in the upper floor, he and his wife used the only cotton-blanket they

129 The news of the Messenger of Allah arriving in Madinah and his saying:
"Leave her, for it is commanded," has been reported by Ibn Sa'd (1/236237) through a Connected (Muttasil) chain. Its narrators are reliable, except
for Waqidi. Ibn Ishaq also reported it through a Hasan chain.-Ibn Hisham
(2/159). As regards the words of the Prophet, "A man is with his saddle,"
they are cited from a report in Bayhaqi in Dalail (2/509) via a chain in
which occurs ' Attaf bin Khalid who was weak. Ibn Hajar remarked about
him, "A reliable man given to illusions." Also, it is not reported that
Siddiq bin Musa narrated from 'Abdullah bin Zubayr. It is possible that
he never met him. In addition, Dhahabi said about him in Al-Mizan, He
cannot be depended upon."
I might point out yet that this Hadith gathers strength from the reports of
this incident through a narration in Ibn Ishaq through a Hasan chain.
130 Reported by Muslim (3/1623-1624/H. 2053 and others).

332

The Prophet of Islam

had to prevent the water leaking down on the Prophet jit.131 It is
reported that this became the reason why Abu Ayyub requested the
Prophet
to exchange the floors.132 But Muslim133 and Ahmad134
report that the reason was that Abu Ayyub and his wife didn't wish to
walk over the Prophet's head. We accept this as more trustworthy
because of the more reliable source. It is also reported that the
Prophet's total period of stay in Abu Ayyub's house was a month.13"

1,1 This was reported by Ibn Ishaq through a Hasan chain — Ibn Hisham (2/
164); and Hakim (3/460) who said: "Sahih according to Muslim's
conditions, although the two did not recount it." Dhahabi agreed with the
statement in his Talkhis.
132 Reported by Ibn Hajar in Al Isabah (1/415) where he ascribed it to Ibn
Abu Shaybah and Ibn Abu 'Asim through Abu Khayr, Abu Ruhm and
Abu Ayyub.
133Muslim (3/1623/H. 2053).
134 Ahmad: Al-Fath (20/293).
135 This was mentioned in a Hadith narrated by Abu Ayyub in Hakim's AlMustadrak (3/461) over which he remained silent, as also Dhahabi. I would
say that by this route the Hadith is fabricated for there falls in it 'Abdullah
bin Zahr, 'Ali bin Yazid, Qasim, and Abu 'Abdur-Rahman. Ibn Hibban said
about him in the biography of 'Abdullah bin Zahr: "He narrates fabricated
reports through reliable chains. When he narrates through 'Ali bin Yazid,
then he narrates destructive ones. And, if in any chain you have together
'Abdullah, 'Ali bin Yazid, Qasim, and Abu 'Abdur-Rahman, then the report
can be no other than a fabrication at their hands." Despite all this the report
happens to be close to reason. This is supported by what Bayhaqi recorded
in his Dald'il (2/509) which says that the Prophet jge stayed in the hut
wherein Ibn Zurarah used to pray with a group of Muslims before the
arrival of the Prophet #§ for 12 days-until the Mosque was built. Bayhaqi's
chain is not so credible because of the fall of Siddiq therein, who was not so
trustworthy; and 'Attaf, a trustworthy man but who suffered illusions.
Further, we could not find the biography of Bayhaqi's Shaykh. If we add to
this the period during which the houses of the Prophet's wives were built,
then the total works out to a month. Ibn Hajar mentioned in At-Tahdhib
(9113) that the Prophet ge stayed in the house of Abu Ayyub a month until
his Mosque was built. Ibn Sa'd (1/237) said through a Connected (Muttasil)
chain and its narrators are trustworthy except Waqidi —that he % stayed
seven months. Ibn Hajar mentioned it in Al-Fath (15/101 and 109) through
Ibn Sa'd, without raising any objection to it. Ibn Kathir also mentioned it in
Al-Bidayah wan-Nihdyah (3/231 and 235) adding, "Some others have said
that it was less than a month. Allah knows best."

Emigration to Madirtah

And no night would pass but three or four Ansari Companions
would be at the Prophet's door seeking to bring in food for him until
he moved to his own house.136
Abu Bakr 4® had alighted at Hubayb's house. Some have said
that it was Khubayb bin Yasaf who lived in Sunh. Another report
says that the host was Kharijah bin Zayd.137

Lessons and Instructions

1.

The Prophet
announced in the sermon after the fall of Makkah
that there was to be no more emigration after the Makkan victory,
except that Jihad and intention remained.138 The reference was to
the emigration from Makkah to Madinah. However, emigration
from non-Muslim lands to the Muslim lands has remained
obligatory until the Day of Judgement.139 Emigration to Madinah
was necessary in order to establish the Islamic state, defend it, and
then expand it by means of invitation to Allah ($Ss). Emigration
from Makkah to Madinah after its fall was not necessary because
Muslims had gained strength in the Islamic state which became
their springboard to carry on the mission to all parts of the world.
As for Jihad, it will go on until the Judgement Day. Accordingly,
when the Prophet #1 took pledge from the new Muslims after the
fall of Makkah, it was on Islam, faith and Jihad. Emigration was
excluded.140 Ibn 'Umar
clarified this when he said,
"Emigration to the Prophet
was suspended after the fall of
Makkah. But emigration (to an Islamic state) will remain in force

136 A narration of Ibn Sa'd (1/233) mentioned earlier. Ibn Kathir also
mentioned it in Al-Bidayah wan-Nihayah (3/222).
137Haythami said in Al-Majma (6/63): "Reported by Tabarani and its
narrators are reliable." It was reported by Ibn Ishaq through a Hasan
chain — Ibn Hishdm (3/157), and it is a part of that Hadith of Ibn Ishaq
which deals with the people of Madinah waiting for the advent of the
Prophet #1 as an emigrant.

so long as there is a struggle with the non-Muslims." What he
meant is, so long as there is disbelief in the world, emigration is
obligatory on any Muslim who feels that he might have to make
compromises over his religion.141
This can be supported with Allah's Words,

"Those whom the angels meet in a state in which they had
wronged their own souls saying, 'In what condition were you?'
They say, 'We were weak in the lands.' They ask, 'Wasn't Allah's
earth wide enough for you to emigrate into it?' They, their abode
is Hell-fire, except for the weak men, women and children who do
not find a means nor know the way. "142
The above were the conditions that led to the establishment of the
Islamic state in Madinah. Its need for soldiers who could defend it
made it necessary that emigration to it should be made obligatory on
every able Muslim. Khattabi has said, "Emigration to Madinah was in
its defense and to acquire the necessary knowledge of Islam. Allah (5c)
stated this clearly in several Verses of the Qur'an. He severed the ties
between a man who migrated and another who did not. He said.

"Those who believed but did not emigrate, you have no

When Makkah fell, and people from every tribe entered into
Islam, emigration became non-obligatory."

Tabari said in explaining "responsibility whatsoever towards them," that it
means helping them.

Emigration to Madinah

335

In the light of the above, we might add that if any non-Muslim
state allows for easy practice of Islamic way of life and invitation to
it, then living there is better than leaving it. Emigration is not
obligatory on the Muslims. That is because, the said state is counted
as a land of peace. Living in it would be better than moving out
because living there might help in the propagation of Islam.144
2.

The Prophet ^ used every means that reason would demand
while undertaking his journey. It was not out of fear for himself or
that he might fall into p£gan hands, rather it was to set an example
for the Muslims who should learn to make use of every possible
material means while attempting to do anything in life. That is
because it is Allah's Sunnah that when means are available for
someone who can take suitable measures, then He does not nullify
the need for them. He does that when there is no recourse to means,
as He did with Ibrahim: when he was thrown into the Fire. It was
ordered to cool down for him. In such events it becomes a miracle
of the Prophet involved, and, if it is a non-Prophet who is involved
then it becomes a thaumaturgy. In evidence of what we have
stated, it might be brought to notice that after the Prophet
had
taken every precaution possible, he was in the least fear during the
journey, although his Companion Abu Bakr
W3.S very uneasy.
That was perhaps because the latter had some measure of
dependence on means that were employed.

In short, everything that the Prophet it did in regard to his
safety was only to set an example for his followers. After he had
employed them, his heart returned to the state of peace trusting
Allah (ii). This wash order that the Muslims should know that in
all situation it is in Allah (fg) with whom they should place their
trust, and that such trust does not deny employing material means
for the achievement of the objectives.145
3.

' Ali's acceptance to lie down in the Prophet's bed in the night of
emigration demonstrates his strong faith and great courage. The
action also legalizes the means of deceit against the enemy to

defeat his evil purposes.
4.

The part played by the youth in the implementation of the
Prophet's plan of journey, such as of 'Ali and Abu Bakr's two
sons, will remain a model for young men of all time.

5.

The miracles that accompanied the Prophet ^ through and
through the journey were a way to prove that Allah ($g) was with
him all the time and that He was going to help him establish His
religion on the earth, whether the time it took was long or short.

6.

The role that Abu Bakr 4* played in this journey was a great
achievement on his part. It was of such order that even Allah's
revelation mentioned him, although indirectly. It was said.

"The second of the two when they were in the cave when he was
telling his companion, 'Be not vexed, Allah is with us.'"
7.

Abu Ayyub 4* and his wife's efforts at obtaining the
benediction of the Prophet
and the Prophet's own
agreement to it, lead us to believe that it is allowable to obtain
such benedictions where found.146

8.

The manner in which Abu Ayyub and his wife treated the
Prophet ^ demonstrated the Companions' love of the Prophet
sl|. This is something that we will repeatedly come across in
their life and character.

9.

The Prophet's refusal to eat a food containing raw garlic was
something special to him. He made it lawful to the Muslims on
condition that they should not visit the mosque immediately
after consuming such food. Further, the Prophet ^ advised
those who wish to consume it that they should kill its smell by
first cooking it.147

146See Albani in this regard, At-Tazvassul: Anwauhu zva Ahkamuhu, pp. 142-147.
147 Muslim (1/396/H. 567). Apart from him others also recorded it.

Foundations of the Islamic
Society and State in Madinah

Construction of the First Mosque

Some Muslims had begun to pray on the spot at which the
Prophet's camel had halted. It was then a sort of an open stable for
camels and a yard for processing dates. It was owned by Sahal and
Suhayl. They were orphans of the Banu Najjar tribe living in the
quarters of As'ad bin Zurarah. When the camel had halted there the
Prophet s|§ had said, "This, Allah willing, is the destination."
Subsequently, he asked the two boys to be brought forth to work
out a price for the piece of land.1 He wished to build a mosque there.
The two said they didn't need any money. But the Prophet
refused to accept the plot free of cost. He bought it at a price and
then began to construct the mosque.2 Bukhari3 has a report that
when he intended to build a mosque, the Prophet |§; asked for the
Banu Najjar. When they came, he said to them, "O Banu Najjar, sell

Ibn Hajar said in Al-Fath (15/101): "Regarding the narration of Ibn

but to tell them the truth."

me this piece of land.” They refused to accept a price saying.

By

Allah, we shall accept no price but from Allah.
Ibn Hajar4 has said that some people have argued that it proves
that a sale deed is possible without the presence of the owners as in
this case when the two boys were not present. But others have
replied that it is possible that their uncle, with whom they were
living, made the deal on their behalf as other reports suggest.
Trustworthy reports add that the place of choice had a few
pagan graves also, and that it was a deserted site with a few palm
trees. The Prophet m ordered that the pagan graves be dug out, the
land cleaned up and the palm trees cut down. They used the trunks
for making the front portion that was to have the Qiblah (prayer
direction), constructing the two side walls with stones. The Prophet
^ also helped them in collecting the stones.5 He was singing the
words:

"This load is better than that ofKhayber,
This is better with our Lord and more rewarding."
The Verses mean to say that the loads that pay off at Khayber
when moved from place to place, are less rewarding than this load.
He was also singing:

"O Lord! True reward is the reward of the Hereafter,
Show mercy then to the Ansar and the Muhdjir."6
It is reported that others were also echoing his words while
carrying stones and singing:
"O Lord! Nothing is truly good except the good of the Hereafter,

Therefore, help the Ansar and the Muhdjir."7 8
One of the Muslim poets said on that occasion:

"If we sat down while the Prophet worked,
That surely would be a misguided deed."*

'Ali bin Abu Talib said in a piece of his own:
"Not equal is he who visits the mosques,
Frequenting it, sitting and standing.
And he who is seen escaping from the dust."
During the construction, the Prophet s|| gave preference to
anyone who excelled in a trade. Talaq bin 'Ali Yamami Hanafi said
to the Companions working there, “Hand over the plastering to the
Yamami for he is bettef than you all in mixing and application."
According to another report coming from him, “I took some sand
and mixed it well with water. That pleased the Prophet and he said,
'Let the Hanafi work with the plastering, for he does a good job of
it.'"9 The words according to the report in Bayhaqi are,10 “Hand
over the plastering to the Yamami, for he is better than you at
construction."
'Ammar bin Yasir was another person who was very active
during the construction of the mosque. While everyone carried one
brick, he carried two: one for himself, another on behalf of the
Prophet $g. The Prophet jig passed his hand over his back and
remarked, “O son of Sumaiyah, you shall have twice the reward.
Your last meal will be milk and you will be killed by a rebellious
party."11
9

Jbn Hajar mentioned these two narrations in Al-Fath (3/112), and said:
"Reported by Ahmad."

10 One of the narrations of Talaq. See the narration of Bayhaqi in his Dald'il
(2/545) with an authentic chain. Its origin is in the Sunan books. Ibn Hajar
in Al-Isabah (2/232), and Al-Fath (3/112), and Ibn Hibban in his Zawd'id, p.
98, H. 303 with the following words: "I asked O Messenger of Allah, shall
I carry what they carry?" The Prophet
said, "No, but mix the clay for
them as you know it better."
11 Reported by Muslim (4/2236/H. 2916) and Ahmad: The Musnad (3/5) and
(4/319); Hakim (3/389) and said: "Authentic on the conditions of the Two
while they themselves dkPnot trace it." Also Al-Bukhdri/Al-Fath (3/110/H.
447) without the words, "The rebellious party will kill you." Ibn Hajar
sees some weakness for this. In the Hadith of Bukhari, Ahmad, Hakim,
and 'Abdur-Razzaq, it was mentioned that these words were spoken out
during the construction of the mosque. As for the narrations of Muslim
through Abu Nadrah (4/2236/H. 2916), it tells us that they were said

The Prophet of Islam

340

This Hadith (tradition) is of course one of the proofs of his
prophethood. 'Ammar was indeed killed in the conflict between 'Ali
and Mu'awiyyah (may Allah be pleased with both). He was on
'Ali's side and was killed by Mu'awiyyah's soldiers. He died in the
state the Prophet

had described. Ibn Kathir1^ and Ibn Hajar

have explained the Hadith adequately.
The construction took some twelve days.14 It was after its
completion that the quarters for his wives were built in the same
manner; and it was after the construction was complete for them
that the Prophet

moved out from the house of Abu Ayyub. Both

Sawdah 4 and 'Aishah 415 had a house each. Subsequently, as he
married more women, more houses were built. They were small
houses with a little open yard in front of them.16 Some were built

during the digging of the trench. Hence Bayhaqi said in Dalail (2/550), “It
is possible that Abu Nadrah was erroneously led to believe that it
happened during the trench digging. Or, it is possible that he said it twice:
during the mosque construction and during the trench digging. Allah
knows best." Ibn Kathir added his notes (3/238) to Bayhaqi's by saying,
"Brick carrying has no meaning with reference to the trench digging. It
seems that the reporter got mixed up. Allah knows best." I say, "This
means Ibn Kathir does not agree with Bayhaqi's reconciliation effort that
this was said twice, but rather believes that it happened during the
mosque construction. See different routes of this Hadith by Bayhaqi in his
Dala'il (2/547-553), and Ibn Kathir in Al-Bidayah wan-Nihayah (3/237-238),
taking it from 'Abdur-Razzaq, adding, "This meets with the conditions set
by the Shaykhayn."
12 Al-Bidayah wan-Nihayah (3/238-239).
13 Al-Fath (3/110-112).
14 This was mentioned in the narration of 'Abdullah bin Zubayr in Dalail of
Bayhaqi.
15 See Ibn Hajar: Al-Fath (15/78) as a Tabarani's narration, Ibn Kathir in AlBidayah (3/222), and Ibn Sa'd (1/240), for the description of his wives'
houses, see Ahmad: Al-Fathul-Rabbani (21/6-7), and Ibn Kathir in AlBidayah (3/241-242).
16 Ibn Kathir placed it in his Al-Bidayah (3/241) without a chain. Shami said
in Subulul-Huda (3/508): Ibn Sa'd and Bukhari in Al-Adabul-Mufrad, Ibn
Abu Dunya, and Bayhaqi in his Ash-Shu'ab, reported that Hasan Basri
said: "When I was a teenager, I used to enter the houses of the wives of
the Prophet sjg during the caliphate of 'Uthman bin 'Affan, and I used to

from frond while others from stones with frond in the roof.17 Some
reports say the roofs were made from cypress tree material.18 The
doors didn't have frames.19 Subsequently, after the death of the
Prophet's wives, all these houses were incorporated into the mosque
during the time of 'Abdul-Malik.20
The Adhan (call for prayer) as we hear it now, was introduced in
the first year itself, according to the better opinion. 'Abdullah bin
Zayd dreamed the words. So the Prophet

ordered Bilal 4® to call

out using those words. When 'Umar 4b heard the Adhan he came up
saying he too had heard the words of 'Abdullah bin Zayd in a vision
of his.21
The mosque remained as built by the Prophet

with Abu

Bakr 4fe making no changes in it. 'Umar 4® made some alterations.
He changed its pillars to ones of timber and got the roof sealed.
'Uthman 4b expanded it greatly altering the walls to decorated ones.
He also got the pillars done in decorated stone and laid the roof with
sheets.22
'Umar had ordered that red and yellow colors be avoided in the
construction of the mosque so as not to distract the devotees.

The Prophet of Islam

342

At the beginning the Prophet's mosque didn t have a pulpit
platform for him to climb to deliver the speeches. He used to rest on
a palm trunk while delivering sermons. When a pulpit was made
and he shifted on to it, the palm trunk could be heard crying like a
she-camel. The Prophet

came down and patted it and it gradually

fell silent as does a kid when patted.24 This was another of the
proofs of the Prophet's authenticity.
The best comment made is that of Hasan Basri who said after
reporting Anas's narration, himself weeping, "O Muslims. We are
worse than timber in our love for the Prophet #§. Shouldn't those
who wish to meet him demonstrate greater love?"After its completion, the mosque was, first and foremost, a place
for worship. But, it met with other purposes, such as:
1) Poor emigrants took shelter in it, especially those who were
unmarried and couldn't find a house for themselves. They were
known as the 'People of the Platform (Ahlus-Suffah).'2b
2) It was a refuge for Muslim women, such as Walidah Sawda',
who migrated but could not find a house to live in and so pitched a
small tent for herself in its yard.27
3) A place of education for the Muslims.
4) A place where poetry was said in reply to satires against

24 See the different versions of the Hadith in various words in Al-Bukhdri and
its explanation in Al-Fath (14/95/H. 3584, 3585); Ibn Kathir in Al-Bidayah
(3/239-240) and the present context is his. Bayhaqi also quoted it in his
Dald’il (2/556-563) from several sources and said at the end, "The reports
we have presented in connection with the camel's moaning, are all
trustworthy." The verifier Qala'ji said, "These are Continuous (Mutawatir)
reports that have come down from several Companions, through a variety
of chains which prove it beyond doubt." (p. 563). 1 might add that
Bukhari's narration should suffice.

5) A place where prisoners were kept, especially when the
objective was to teach them Islam. They saw the prayers performed
there and heard the admonitions of the Prophet ^ and recitation of
the Qur'an. That softened them as it happened in case of Thumamah
bin Uthal.
6. Tents used to be pitched for the treatment of the injured
picked up from battlefields. Rafidah's tent during the Battle of the
Trench is an example.29 ' ' *
7. A place to receive foreign delegates that came to the Prophet

jg|.
8. A place for distribution of military standards to the troops
that were sent out.
9. A place for Muslims to meet their leader. This has two
advantages:
(a) The ability of the leader to know first hand the situation of
his followers through personal contact and,
(b) The ability of the Muslims to know one another more closely
and help each other out in times of difficulties.
With the passage of time, many of the above functions have
been taken off the mosques because of the failure to appreciate the
true functions of mosques in Islam. They have now been turned into
mere places of worship.

Wisdom and Lessons in the Construction of the Prophet’s
Mosque
1.

From the precedence of the Prophet's decision to buy off the
land from the elders of the family, rather than from the orphans,
the jurists have ruled that any deal entered into with a minor is
null and void. The Qur'an also supports this rule. It says.

28 Al-Bukhari/Al-Fath (3/118/H. 453). See the explanation of Ibn Hajar to the
reports in this chapter.
29 AlBukhari/Al-Fath (3/129/H. 461, 463).

"And do not go near the orphan's wealth except by goodly means
- until he reaches the age of puberty."30
As for the reports that say that the Prophet £g purchased the
land directly from the two orphans, it might be argued that in this
case the Prophet |§; himself acted as their custodian being in fact a
custodian of the Muslims in the general sense. The ruling by some
scholars based on this Hadith then-that dealings with the minors
are lawful —is not very strong, for the Verse quoted above goes
against reports in the Hadith literature. The scholars have more to
say in regard to dealings with minors. For example,31
(a) His dealings are termed defective, such as his acceptance of
gifts which is otherwise legally allowable.
(b) His dealings are harmful when he endows something, which
is legally disallowed.
(c) If a minor's dealings allow for swing between profits and
losses in business affairs they are subject to the permission of the
custodian.
2.

The Prophet's action of getting ancient pagan graves dug out
and cleansed proves its legality for the sake of constructing
mosques, if the land is otherwise suitable.

3.

The Hadith also gives us to believe that a land in which the dead
have been buried long ago, can be sold away; and that it remains
the property of the owners unless given out in charity.32

4.

Going by the simplicity followed by the Prophet $*&, and by
'Umar's instruction to the builders in words, "Save the people
from rain water, but avoici red and yellow colors,"33 the

scholars have disapproved of decorations of the mosques, while
some have totally forbidden it.34
5.

Scholars have disagreed over inscriptions of Qur'anic Verses on
the front wall of the mosque whether it is permitted or not.
Zarkashi says,35 "It is undesirable to inscribe on the front wall
Verses of the Qur'an or something else." Malik said, "Some
scholars have allowed it in the light of 'Uthman doing it in the
Prophet's mosque with no one then objecting to it."

Institution of Brotherhood
When the Muhajir arrived from Makkah, they had nothing in
their possession, having left their wealth and property behind.
Therefore, although they knew nothing about farming, the Ansar,
who were a fanning people, allowed them to labor in their orchards
and fields at half the produce as their wage. Some of them gifted
away some of their property outright. The Muhajir returned the
lands after the fall of Khayber. The Prophet ^ also returned their
gifts after Banu Qurayzah and Banu Nadir had vacated their
dwellings.36

Ansar's treatment of the Muhajir in this manner was of course a
sign of their love for them and a proof of their sacrifice. Allah (H)
Himself bore witness in words.

34 See Buti, pp. 154-155. Ibn Hajar said in Al-Fath (3/108-109): "The first to
decorate mosques was Walid bin Abdul-Malik bin Marwan, which was at
the end of the Companions' era. Many people of knowledge kept quiet in
order to avoid disturbance and commotion, while some have approved it
including Abu Hanifah who conditioned its legality if veneration of the
mosques is the objective and nothing is spent on it from the governmental
treasury. Ibn Munir said, "When people began to decorate their houses, it
became necessary to decorate the mosques also to avoid their belittling." It
has been said however that if the prevention is in order to follow the Salaf
and giving up of adornment, then it is as he said. However, if it is feared
that it will affect the concentration of the devotee because of the
decoration, then the original prohibition remains.

They love those who have migrated to them, finding no

Their sacrifice was of such order that they said to the Prophet
«!!, “If you wished you could take our houses." The Prophet
praised them but preferred to construct new houses for the Muhdjir
over lands that the Ansar had gifted or in lands that belonged to no
one. 38
The Ansar also suggested that the Prophet
divide the
orchards between them and the Muhdjir. He said, "Rather, let them
help you out and share the produce with you." They said, "We have
heard, and we shall obey."39
The Prophet
also told the Ansar, "Your brothers have left
back their wealth and property and have come down to you." They
said, "Our wealth stands divided between us and them." The

37 Surat Al-Hashr: 9. See Al-Bukhdri/Al-Fath (14/261/H. 3776).
38 This was said by Baladhuri in Ansdbul-Ashraf (1/270). Its origin is in a
Hadith of Al-Bukhdri/Al-Fath (15/123/H. 3929) where it is mentioned that
the Ansar drew lots to assign dwellings to the Muhdjir.
39 Al-Bukhdri/Al-Fath (14/264/H. 3782), Ahmad: Al-Fathur-Rabbdni (21/100).
Ibn Kathir mentioned it in Al-Bidayah (3/250) and said: “This Ftadith has
come down through three chains. It meets with the conditions set by the
Shaykhayn. However, none of the Six recorded it through this chain. But it
is a trustworthy report. Sa'ati has the same to say in his commentary on
Musnad. Dr. Sa'ud however censored the two (Hijrah thesis, p. 249). He
said, “They erred in their statements for Tirmidhi has indeed recorded it
saying, 'This is a Good & Unfamiliar (Hasan-Gharib) report from this
route.'" See Sahih Sunan At-Tirmidhi (2/303-304, chapters describing
Doomsday, chapter 14). Albani said, “Trustworthy." The Hadith has
narrators of the Sahihayn.

Prophet 0 replied, "Rather, let there be some other arrangement."
They asked, "What could that be?" He replied, "They are a people
unused to work (in the farms). So, teach them how to work and then
divide the produce between yourselves." They agreed.40
Bukhari41 has reported through Anas 4*'- "The Prophet 0 asked
the Ansar to assemble themselves so that he could divide the
Bahrain tribute among them. They said, 'No. Not unless you grant
similar share to our brother Muhajir.' He said, 'If you say no, then
you better observe patience until you meet me (in the Hereafter).
For, in days after me you will encounter prejudice (against you)."'
And neither did the Ansar fail, nor showed a lack of spirit in
treating well the Prophet's guests. Bukhari42 has preserved a report
that a man went to the Prophet 0 hungry. He did not find anything
with his wives to offer him to eat. So, the Prophet 0 sought from his
Companions that they extend treatment to his guest. One of the

Ansar agreed. But he had nothing at home except what would be
enough for him, his wife and children. So he put the children to
sleep and his wife presented the food to the guest. Then they put out
the lamp and pretended that they were eating with him, although
they went to bed hungry. Allah (M) revealed about them, "And they

give preference to others over themselves even if there be great need."
However, despite the sacrifices on behalf of the Ansar, the
Prophet 0 wished to institute an Islamic solution to the economic
problem and to let the Muhajir realize that they were not entirely the
responsibility of the Ansar. Accordingly, he instituted brotherhood
in the first year of emigration.43 It is reported that the announcement

40 Ibn Kathir mentioned‘it in Al-Bidayah (3/250) although we could not find
its origin. Nonetheless, meaningwise it is authentic.
41 Al-Fath (14/270/H. 3794).
42 Al-Fath (14/271-272/H. 3797).
43 Ibn Hajar said in Al-Fath (15/130): They differed over when was it
officiated, for it was said that it started five months after Hijrah (Ibn
'Abdul-Barr, Ad-Durar, p./?6). Another opinion is that it was and it was
nine months after Hijrah (although I do not know who said this). Yet
another opinion is it happened while he was building the mosque (AdDurar, p. 96, and 'Uyunul-Athar, 1/200). It was also said that it took place
a year and a quarter before Badr. Ibn Sa'd (1/238) said that it took place
after Hijrah and before Badr.

The Prophet of Islam

to that effect was made in Anas bin Malik's house.44 Others have
reported that it took place in the mosque 45 It has also been said that
it took place twice: once in Makkah between the Makkan Muslims
themselves, and a second time between them and the Madinans.
This is the one that has been discussed here.46
Ibn Sa'd47 has reported through his Shaykh Waqidi through
various second-generation narrators that when the Prophet
arrived at Madinah he instituted brotherhood among the Muhajir
and Ansar. They were to help each other and inherit each other at
death, to the exclusion of the kin. They were ninety in total: fortyfive from the Muhajir and forty-five from the Ansar. Some have said
that they were a hundred, fifty from each.
Bukhari48 has reported through Ibn 'Abbas

that when the

Muhajir arrived at Madinah, they inherited the Ansar to the
exclusion of other Ansar in accordance with the brotherhood rules.

44 This was said by Anas 4®. See Al-Bukhari: Al-Fath (10/41/H. 2294); Muslim
(4/196/H. 2529); Ahmad in Al-Fathur-Rabbani (21/7-8) and Abu Dawud
through different routes quoting Anas. Its text is: "The Prophet
made
alliance between the Muhajir and Ansar in my house." See Ibn Kathir in
Al-Bidayah (3/245), and Ibn Sad (1/238-239).
45 This was said by Abu Sa'eed in Sharful-Mustafa, as mentioned by Ibn Hajar in
Al-Fath (15/130). It looks like and Allah knows best that there is no
contradiction between these statements. For, the brotherhood was not
instituted in one sitting but rather it depended on the acceptance of Islam and
arrival of new Muhajir into Madinah. Of course, whatever is reported in the
Sahih is to be received preference, and all that Muslim's text tells us that the
brotherhood between the Muhajir and Ansar started in the house of Anas
46 This was said by Ibn 'Abdul-Barr in Ad-Durar, p. 100.
47 At-Tabaqat (1/238). Ibn Sa'd was not the only one to mention the
brotherhood between the Muhajir themselves in Madinah as pointed out
by Dr. 'Umari in Al-Mujtama' Al-Madni fi 'Ahdin-Nubuwwah, p. 75. Hakim
also reported in Al-Mustadrak and Diya' in Al-Mukhtarah on the authority
of Ibn 'Abbas
who said, "The Prophet ’M instituted brotherhood
between Zubayr and Ibn Mas'ud." Ibn Hajar mentioned this in Al-Fath
(15/131) declaring its chain as just about Good (Flasan). Ibn Hajar also
said in Al-Fath (15/131) commenting on this chain, "When this is
combined with what has preceded, then it gets stronger."
48 Al-Fath (17/112-113/H. 4580), and see Tajsir Ibn Kathir (2/255).

However, Ibn Hajar49 has said that the reason for brotherhood
was that some of the Muhajir were stronger than others of the
Muhajir themselves in terms of wealth, size of the family and other
points of measure. So, the Prophet j|g instituted brotherhood in
order that the weaker should become equal with the stronger.
Hence, he declared ' Ali his own brother, for, in the pre-Islamic times
it was he who was supporting 'Ali. So was the brotherhood between
Hamzah and Zayd bin Harithah, for Zayd was the freed slave of
Hamzah's family. Thus, sometimes a Muhajir was made a brother of
another Muhajir.50
Following

the

above

principle,

the

Prophet

3g§

declared

brotherhood between himself and 'Ali,51 between Zubayr and Ibn
Mas'ud,52 'Abdur-Rahman bin 'Awf and Sa'd bin Rabi',53 Salman
Farisi and Abu Darda',54 Abu 'Ubaydah and Abu Talhah,55 'Umar

49 See Al-Fath (15/129).
50 Ibn Ishaq mentioned creation of brotherhood between the Prophet |j| and 'Ali,
and between Hamzah and Zayd—Ibn Hisham (2/171-172) without a chain.
51 This has come in a Hadith reported by Hakim in his Al-Mustadrak (3/14)
via a chain in which falls Ishaq bin Bishr Kahili and Jumai' bin 'Umayr
Tamimi. But he offered no comments. Dhahabi however said that Jumai'
was accused of lying while Kahili was considered a destroyer. Ibn Hajar
said in Al-Fath (15/131) after quoting several Ahadith that mention
brotherhood between 'Ali & and the Prophet sjg, “When this is combined
with what has preceded, it becomes stronger." See Ibn Ishaq — Ibn Hisham
l^./172) without a chain. The two verifiers of Zad said (3/64), “The reports
that have come in connection with the brotherhood between the Prophet
#§ and 'Ali are all weak. The report that Tirmidhi has in his collection
(3722) has Jumai' bin 'Umayr in its chain who was charged by Ibn Hibban
of forgery." Ibn Numayr said, “He was most lying of all."
52 The source of this Hadith has been cited earlier. Ibn Ishaq has it that he
declared brotherhood between Zubayr and Salamah bin Waqsh. See Ibn
Hisham 1/1/177)). However, this has a weak chain.
53 This is in Al-Bukhdri/Al-Fath (14/263-64/H. 3780).
54 Al-Bukhdri/Al-Fath (15/132/H. 3936) and Ibn Sa'd: At-Tabaqdt (4/80-85) by
different routes. Ibn Sa'd .too has it but through a weak chain that he
declared brotherhood between Abu Darda' and 'Awf bin Malik Ashja'i.
See At-Tabaqdt (4/80) and Ibn Hajar: Al-Fath (15/131) who is the one who
indicated that Ibn Sa'd's chain is weak. But of course, reliable is only that
which is in the Sahih works.

bin Khattab and 'Itban bin Malik.and between Abu bakr and
Kharijah bin Zayd.
Ibn Ishaq5 has listed manv names of those between whom the
Prophet #§ declared brotherhood. Ibn Hajar''' has studied them and
given answers to some of the doubts that arise therewith. °
As to how it was received, we might consider a single ease that
of 'Abdur-Rahman bin 'Awf and Sad bin Rabi . Sa d told AbdurRahman, "I am the richest of the Ansar. So. let me divide mv wealth
into tw'o halves. Let one half be yours. Make a decision about one ot
my wives and I'll divorce her in your favor. ‘ Abdur-Rahman
replied, “1 don't need either. Instead, show me the wav to the
marketplace." He showed him the way to the Banu Quynuqah
markets. He did not return from there but he had some butter and
cheese with him. As he kept visiting the markets, he earned enough
to be on his own, independent of his brother's help. Finally he
married a woman from the Attsdr offering her gold the si/e of a date
seed as dowry. The Prophet % told him to host a dinner even it he
had to slaughter a single goat.1'0
The Prophet
also declared brotherhood in order to cure
loneliness and alienation felt by the Muhajir in the new
surroundings and to lessen the grief of being awav from their
wives, family and friends. With the passage of time when Islam
grew stronger, loneliness was no more a problem. In a short time
the Immigrants had indulged deeper in life, knew how to make a
living, and so the special laws of one inheriting the other were
declared null and void, leaving the brotherhood of Islam in place.

Biday ah (3/249) on the authority of Anas 4'.
56 Ibn Hajar said in Al-Fath (15/131): "It has been mentioned before at the
beginning of (ch. on) Salat that 'Umar said: 1 used to have a brother from
the Ansar." It was explained that this was Itban bin Malik. Ibn Ishaq
mentioned it without a chain — Ibn Hisham (2/173).

those who joined in the brotherhood, citing different sources.

"T7ze kinsfolk have greater rights upon each other in the Book of

These Verses came down after the battle of Badr.62 Some say
after Uhud 63
Ibn 'Abbas i^64 has said that the brotherhood itself was never
declared null and void. It was only the rule of the Muhajir and Ansar
inheriting each other that was declared null and void. As for help
and support of each other which was required of those in the new
system, it remained in force, with the possibility that some of them

252).
62 Ibn Sa'd: At-Tabaqat (1/238) through Waqidi.
63 This was said by Ibn Sa'd, Ibn Hatim and Hakim. Ibn Marduwayh
declared it trustworthy as mentioned by 'Umari in Al-Mujtama' Al-Madni,
p. 78, re-quoting from Lubdbun-Nuqul (p. 260), and Shawkani in FathulQadeer (2/330-331).
64 In a Hadith that is reported'by Al-Bukhdri/Al-Fath (17/11-13/H. 4580), and
the supporting material is in its text: "When the following Verse was
revealed, 'And for everyone We have made supporters,' it (brotherhood)
was abrogated. Then it was said, 'except for what your oaths tie up,' that
is, help, sincerity, etc., inheritance was annulled, although it could be
bequeathed."

The Prophet of Islam

352

left a will for the other. Nawawi has also accepted this interpreta¬
tion.65
What lends credibility to the theory that brotherhood remained
in force without the inheritance clause is the fact that brotherhood
was instituted between Salman Farisi and Abu Darda', although
Salman embraced Islam between the events of Uhud and the battle
of the Ditch.66 Brotherhood between Mu'awiyah and Hutat Tamimi
is another example which must have taken place only after the fall of
Makkah,67 when Mu'awiyah entered into Islam. Hutat himself had
embraced Islam along with the delegates that had arrived in the 9th
year after Hijrah. Similarly,68 brotherhood between Ja'far bin Abu
Talib and Mu'adh bin Jabal could have taken place only after Ja'far's
return from Abyssinia subsequent to the events of Khayber in the
seventh year after Hijrah.b9

Based on the first experiment, it is for Muslims of all times to
enter into such brotherhood, help and support pacts, allowing
them rights on each other more than those of the ordinary rights
and duties on the believers for each other.

There is a good example in 'Abdur-Rahman's decision to stay
independent of the Ansari brother's help.

The Madinan Pact
Once the Prophet |g was well settled in Madinah, he began to
make efforts to define and discipline the relationship between its
various tribal elements. He got a treatise written down which in
time came to be known variously as "the Book," or "the
Manuscript" which the latter day traditionists call "the constitu¬
tion" or "the document."
We wish to present this document in some detail here because
of the importance attached to it by the research students who have
made it the basis for understanding the organization of the new
state in Madinah and regulating the relationship of an Islamic state
with others of the world.

principles of virtue and justice prevalent among the believers.
And the believers will not leave a poor man73 of large family
unaided in matters of blood money and redemption.
•

Believers are to help each other against any oppressor, acting as
one body, even if he (the oppressor) be one of their (non¬
believing) sons.

•

Allah's guarantees are for everyone, to include the lowest among
them in offering protection to anyone, but believers are each
other's supporters, exclusive of the other people.

•

Whoever of the Jews joined with the believers will have their help
and support. They will not be oppressed and others will not be
helped against them.

(b) Articles pertaining to the Pagans
•

A (Madinan) pagan will not provide protection to the life and
property of one of the Quraysh nor shall he provide help and
assistance to one of them against the Muslims.

•

The Quraysh and their allies shall have the right to peace if they
ask, except for those who fought against Islam.

(c) Articles pertaining to the Jews
•

The Jews will offer financial help to the Muslims in their battles
against the pagans.

•

The Jews of Banu' Awf and the Muslims are one body except that
the Jews will follow their own religion, remaining in possession
of their slaves and their other people. As for the other Jews such
as of the Banu Najjar and Banu Harith, they are like the Jews of
Banu 'Awf. The allies of the Jews are to be treated like the main
body of the Jews.

•

No military action will be launched by the Jews without the
consent and agreement of the Prophet

The Jews will bear their own costs, as will the believers. They are
only to help each other when one of the parties of this document
is attacked by an enemy. They are to be sincere to each other; help
being the right of the oppressed.

(d) Articles related to Common Affairs
•

The heart of the town of Yathrib is herewith declared sanctified;
the neighbor is like one's own self, not to be harmed, so long as he
commits no wrong and that no one should provide refuge to
anyone without the permission of its inhabitants.

•

Whatever disagreements that arise between the parties to this
pact will be subjected to Allah's injunctions and taken to
Muhammad

for arbitration.

•

The Quraysh and their allies will not be provided refuge.

•

Those who have signed this document will extend help against
those who invade Yathrib.

•

A man is in peace in all situations whether he went into the open
or remained at home, except for him who oppressed. Surely,
Allah ($g) provides refuge to the pious and the godly and so does
Muhammad #| the Messenger of Allah.

(ii) Sources of the Document74
1. The first who mentioned it in full was Muhammad bin Ishaq
who died in 151 AH.75
74 After Allah's help, we made extensive use of the newest research of
Daydan Yami in connection with the source of this document. It is in:
Bayanul-Haqiqah fil-Hukin 'Alul-Wuthiqcih: Wathiqatul-Madincih; as also the
Master's thesis of Harun Rashid Muhammad Ishaq, still a manuscript
under the heading, Sahiftxful-Madinah: Dirdsah Hadithiyyah wa Tahqiq, and
Dr. Akram 'Umari's Al-Mujtama Al-Madni.
75 See Sirat Ibn Hishdm (2/167-172), without a chain; and it has 52 articles
according to Dr. Awn Sharif Qasim which he has in his book Diplomasiyyatu Muhammad Jg, pp. 241-244; but 47 articles according to the writing

The Prophet ot Islam

2. Imam Ahmad (241 AH) mentioned it in brief saving. ' rhe
Prophet

got a document written which said about the Mu/'uitir

and the Ansar that they would pa)' blood money for each other and
that they would redeem each other's prisoners and deal with
Muslim affairs following principles of virtue.” He narrated this
report at two places in his Musnad.
3. Ahmad bin Abu Khaythamah's report (27^ AH) as mentioned
by Ibn Sayyidin-Nas.'° He reported it in similar manner as did Ibn
Ishaq. However, he gave a complete list of narrators. One of the
narrators is Kathir bin 'Abdullah who is a controversial figure:
some trusting him,78 others not.7'0
4. Narratives by Abu 'Ubayd bin Qasim bin Salam (224 AH).
Two of them are in Al-Amwal (p. 126). One of them is through two
chains. However, the first chain is weak for it stops at Zuhri. Also.

of Harun Rashid, pp. 15-54 without any differences over the contents.
76 See 'Uyunul-Athar (1/197, 19S).
Of those who ascribed weakness to him or accused him of lying: Ibn Abu
Hatim in Al-Jarhu wat-Ta‘dil (7/54); Ibn Hajar in At-Taqrib (2/132);
Dhahabi in Al-Mizdn (3/406-407) and Ibn Hibban in Al-Majruhin (3/221).
7S See Daydan Yami: Bayanul-Haqiqah, pp. 16-19.
g See Harun: Sahifatul-Madinah Al-Muncmnvarah, p. 99. Harun studied it in
detail collecting together all opinions. See pp. 71-100, and talked about the
possibility of being wrong when accusing Kathir of lying, seeing that
Bukhari approved one of his narrations which he mentioned in his Sahib.
It deals with the Creation of the Deeds of the Slaves, and the other with
recitation behind the Imam. Tirmidhi also used him as his narrator in nonSahih works: Tdrikhul-Kabir (2/3/307). When Tirmidhi asked Bukhari about
a Hadith reported through Kathir, Bukhari described it as Hasan. See
Harun, p. 96-98. Following Tirmidhi's approval of the narrator, through
acceptance of a Hadith of his as Sahib, and the declaration of five reports
coming through him as Hasan. See Harun, p. 99. Abu Dawud narrated
through him without making a comment; Yahya bin Sa'eed AnsAri,
Hakim, Ibn Khuzaymah, Fasawi, and others. In sum we might state
Harun that the news of the document that Kathir bin 'Abdullah narrated
does not fall below those reports that Bukhari recorded through Kathir in
reference to the Creation of the Deeds of the Slaves, and recitation behind
the Imam. Tdrikliul-Kabir has it (Harun: p. 298): The chain of Ibn Abu
Khaytaumah is at least Hasan li Ghayrihi (p. 132).

one of the narrators was 'Abdullah bin Salih who was also a
controversial narrator.80 That narration says, "Allah's Messenger #1
got this document written: 'From Muhammad (declaring a pact)
between Muslim believers of the Quraysh and the people of Yathrib
and those who followed them, or joined them and fought with
them.., that they are one party.'" Thereafter he mentioned a long
narration giving out details of blood money in the same manner as
Ibn Ishaq.
The second of the two reports has Yahya bin 'Abdullah in it,81
through Layth, but is also weak. It also stops at Zuhri. One might
pass the same comments about this report as the earlier one, except
for the difference that Yahya bin 'Abdullah is trusted when he
narrates through Layth. 'Abdullah bin Salih has also followed him.
Another report comes through Hajjaj which is also weak
because it stops at Ibn Jurayj who was known for various
weaknesses.82 Its text says, "The Prophet's document was drawn
for Muslims and believers of the Quraysh, the people of Yathrib,
and those who followed them or joined them. It was to the effect
that the believers will not abandon anyone of them without helping
with blood money or redemption money."
A third report is under a chapter titled Gharibul-Hadith (3011).
There are three versions of the report there. The first is through Hafs
through Kathir bin 'Abdullah, he through his father, he through his

80 See At-Taqrib (1/423) where he said about him: "He is truthful with many
mistakes. He was absent minded." Qattan's final opinion about it is that
his Hadith is Hasan-see Tahdhibut-Tahdhib (11/237, 238). Bukhari reported
through him in his notes as well as Abu Dawud, Tirmidhi, and Ibn Majah.
See At-Taqrib (1/433). Also see Harun, pp. 64-65, for other opinions about

it.
81 Reported by Bukhari, Muslim and Ibn Majah, as in At-Taqrib (2/351) and
At-Tahdhib (11/237-238) and Ibn Hibban mentioned him among the
trustworthy ones (9/263). Dhahabi confirmed the opinion and said (AlMizan, 4/392), "His narrative may be used for legal purposes." Harun
said (p. 97), "There is some weakness in his narratives through Malik. As
for those through Layth, there is no such problem and, therefore, he is
trusted, as in At-Taqrib.
82 See Ibn Hajar in Al-Taqrib (1/520).

grandfather. It is brief. We have already spoken about Kathir.
Another report has Hammad bin 'Ubayd83 and Jabir bin Ju'fi,84 both
of whom are weak. It stops at Sha'bi or at Abu Ja'far Muhammad
bin 'Ali Baqir. It is weak because of Hammad and Jabir.
5. Humayd bin Zanjuyah's report (251 AH). He presented it in
his Kitabul-Amwal85 in similar words as of Ibn Ishaq. Most of them
are from Zuhri with 'Abdullah bin Salih as the narrator about whom
we have already mentioned. The narration is then, weak.
6. Imam Bayhaqi's narration (458 AH). He has two narrations in
his Sunan Al-Kubra (8/106). First of them is through 'Uthman bin
Muhammad. He said, "I received this document from the family of
'Umar bin Khattab along with the letter that 'Umar wrote to his
governors. It said, "In the Name of Allah, the Kind, the Merciful.
This is a document from the Prophet

covering the Muslims and

believers of the Quraysh and those who followed them, joined them
and fought with them ... (until) ... and that it is incumbent upon the
believers that they extend help in blood money and redemption
money due from an offender." This report has Muhammad bin
'Abdul Jabbar 'Utaridi in it who was weak,86 and 'Uthman bin
Muhammad, who was trusted by some.87 However he carries other

83 Dhahabi stated in Al-Mizan (1/597) Ibn Abu Hatim's opinion about him
that he, "does not narrate trustworthy reports, and so may not be paid
attention to. Bukhari said that his reports are not to be trusted.
84 Ibn Hajar said in At-Taqrib (1/123), "a weak Shi'ah narrator," and Dhahabi
quoted in Al-Mizan (1/380) Abu Hanifah's opinion that he never met with
a man a bigger liar than him," and Nasa'i's opinion and that of others
that he was abandoned. Yahya bin Qattan's opinion was that his
narratives might not be recorded. Abu Dawud's opinion was that he never
considered him as man of trustworthy reports."
85 (2/ 466/H. 750).
86 Ibn Hajar said about him in At-Taqrib (1/19): "Weak although his reports
in biographical matters are trustworthy." He said in At-Tahdhib (1/15) that
Ibn Abu Hatim ceased reporting through him because of many people's
discussion about him. Ibn Ma'in cried lies against him while Hakim
treated him weak, as did Ibn 'Adi. He mentioned Ibn 'Adi's words that he
doesn't know any narrative from him that was Denounced (Munkar). They
declared him weak because he did not meet any of those he used to
narrate from.
87

He has been trusted by Ibn Ma'in, Tirmidhi and Ibn Hibban—see At-

weaknesses.88 Further, Yunus bin Bukayr surfaces in the report.89
He too was a controversial figure.
The report itself is much shortened in comparison to that of Ibn
Ishaq. It mentions nothing about the Jews. The second report is
similar to the first, more trustworthy,90 but again, has Kathir bin
'Abdullah who has been commented upon.
7. Ibn Abu Hatim's report: He has mentioned it in the foreword
to his book Al-]arhu .wat-Ta'dil.91 He took it through his own
narrators that reaches Awza'i. The latter wrote to 'Abdullah bin
Muhammad —the leader of- the faithful —a long letter. He said
therein, "Zuhri has narrated to me that he found in the Prophet's
document details about a pact made between the Muhajir and Ansar,
which includes the condition that they shall not leave anyone
unaided in blood money or redemption affairs.”
The reporters of this narration are trustworthy except for
'Abbas bin Walid bin Farid.92 He is however a truthful narrator, but
it stops at Zuhri and, and is too short. Probably the reason is that
Awza'i wrote to the leader of the faithful only that part which

Tahdhib (7/152-153). But Nasa'i said that he is not strong. And Ibn Madini
denied those of his Hadith that came through Ibn Musaiyab and Abu
Hurayrah. See: At-Taqrib (2/14/109).
88 That is he took some Ahddith to narrate from another's book whom he
never met and which he never wrote, nor did he hear from him whose
reports he quoted, neither did he have his permission to quote. See
Muqaddimah of Ibn Salah, p. 157.
89 Ibn Hajar said in At-Taqrib (2/384): "He committed mistakes." Bukhari
took from him his notes and in a part of the recitation, so did Muslim,
Abu Dawud, Ibn Majah and Tirmidhi. See At-Taqrib (2/384). Ibn Ma'in
and Abu Khaithamah, Muhammad bin Numayr, 'Ubayd bin Ya'ish and
Ibn Hanbal said he is trustworthy. See At-Tahdhib (11/435-436). And Ibn
Hibban, see The Kitdbuth-Thiqat (7/651). Ibn Abu Shaybah considered him
weak as did Nasa'i wavering about him as weak or very weak. See AtTahdhib (11/436).
90 See them with Harun, pp. 109-111.
91 (1/195-197).
92 This was said by Ibn Hajar in At-Taqrib (1/399) and ATTahdhib (5/131-133)
and Ibn Abu Hatim in Al-Jarhu wat-Ta'dil (6/215), who added that he was
reliable.

The Prophet of Islam

360

concerned him although he probably had the whole document with
him, especially when Zuhri narrated it. The latter's narration comes
quite close to that of Ibn Ishaq.93
8. Ibn Hazin's report (546 AH): He mentioned it in his Al-

Muhalla94 tracing it through Ibn 'Abbas <£&>. The text said, "The
Prophet #t got a document prepared between the Muhajir and Ansar
to the effect that they should help out each other in blood money
and redemption affairs and that they should work at peace and
reformation between the people.
This report has Hajjaj bin Artat and Hakam bin Miqsam. He
judged the former as abandoned and the latter as weak.
One of the researchers has concluded, after reporting all the
versions, that they are all weak and hence cannot be used for
scholarly purposes, except for what is confirmed through traditions
in words or meaning.95 Another researcher's emphasis has been on
the chain of narrators.96 He concludes that Ibn Hisham's report
through Ibn Ishaq is weak for the reasons of Salih occurring in the
chain. One of Ibn Abu Khaythamah's narration is also weak because
of Kathir bin 'Abdullah. He was in fact accused of lying, but such an
accusation is not weighty, in view of Bukhari giving a green signal
to him. He reported through him in books other than his Sahih.
Tirmidhi also reported through him and gave him the trustworthy
status. Abu Dawud reported through him without making a
comment. Yahya bin Sa'eed Ansari, Hakim, Ibn Khuzaymah,
Fasawi and others have also reported through him. In view of this
fact, we can say that Ibn Abu Khaythamah's report is not entirely
untrustworthy.
In truth Ibn Abu Khaythamah did not depend entirely on
Kathir. Bayhaqi has a report following another chain, though only a
piece of the document.

93 See in this connection Bayanul-Haqiqah by Daydan Yami, p. 33.
94 (12/407-408/The Book of 'Al-Awaqil, wal-Qasamah, wa Qatlu Ahlil-Baghi,
ruling no. 2143).
95 See Daydan Yami: Bayanul-Haqiqah, pp. 35-39.
96 See Harun: Sahifatul-Madinah, p. 132.

Foundations of the Islamic Society and State in Madinah

361

The report is not altogether Contradicting (Shadhdh) since there
is nothing in it that contradicts trustworthy reports. Nor is it unique
because of the multiplicity of its chains of narration. Bayhaqi has the
Connected (Muttasil) line of narrators while Ibn Ishaq and Zuhri
have Disconnected (Mursal) ones.
One might then conclude with the above in view that the
reports are not entirely untrustworthy, although perhaps not wholly
trustworthy either.
Dr. 'Umari arrived at the following conclusion. He said,
"Although the document cannot be trusted for legal purposes,
except for what of it has been reported in trustworthy narrations, it
can be used for historical purposes. After all, historical accounts do
not demand very strict standards of criticism, especially when the
document has been reported by so many, one strengthening the
other." He also said in a footnote, "As a whole the report is not
entirely untrustworthy."

(iii) The Document’s Date
One of the researchers has concluded that in fact there were two
documents,97 which the historians have combined together. One of
them deals with the Jews and the other sets down the duties of the

Muhajir and Ansar toward each other. The Jewish document was
written down before Badr and the other after Badr.
As for those textual portions that give us to believe that the
document was made only after the killing of Ka'b bin Ashraf, it
can be assumed that this could be the second ratification of the
original treaty written earlier. The Qur'an too supports the idea
that there were several treaties between the Prophet

and the

Jews.98 It said.

their treaties and they fear not."'**
This Verse seems also to be pointing to the fact that there were
several treaties, as understood by the commentators.100

(iv) Textual Evidences in Sutmab and Historical Works
One of the researchers has spent a good amount of effort to
trace the evidences.101 One of them has already been mentioned
above, viz.. Imam Ahmad's report that has been declared authentic
by Muhammad Shakir as well as Shaykh Banna'. We might also cite
Muslim's102 report which says that the Prophet *£ had allocated the
blood money responsibility on every tribe and had also declared
that it was not allowed for any Muslim to take on himself the
custody of another Muslim's freed slave without his permission.
Abu Dawud103 and Bavhaqi104 have reported that after the
killing of Ka'b bin Ashraf the Jews came to the Prophet % to discuss
the issue. The Prophet

responded by inviting them to enter into a

general treaty between themselves and the Muslims.
Khattabi105 has reported that Ka'b bin Ashraf had entered into
an agreement with him to the effect that he would not aid anyone
against him and will not declare a fight against him. But he went to
Makkah for that specific purpose and returning to Madinah
engaged

himself in

hostile activities against

the Prophet

^5.

Therefore, the Muslims had to do away with him.
Bukhari101' has reported the Prophet's words: "Believers are
equal in blood and they are one party against all others, the lowest
of them standing up in defense of the rest, and a believer shall not be

narrators was termed weak as Harun's research shows.

killed nor anyone of a treaty.” Nasa'i has a report in similar
words.107
Ibn Majah108 reports the Prophet's words, "A believer shall not be
killed in retaliation of a disbeliever.” Another version adds the words,
"Nor should a (criminal) person be covered by a treaty.”109
These bits and pieces confirm that there was a treaty between
the Muhajir and the Ansar as they also confirm the clauses covering
blood money.
One of the researchers has presented eight110 Ahadith that
corroborate the treaties as having taken place between various
parties: Muhajir, Ansar and jews. Three of them are in Ahmad, one
each in Musannaf of 'Abdur-Razzaq, Abu Dawud, Khattabi's

Mu'alimus-Sunan and two in Bayhaqi's As-Sunan Al-Kubra. All of
them are either Sahih of status or Hasan, except for ' Abdur-Razzaq's
report which is a Disconnected one {Mursal).
Historians have also identified pieces of the treaties in their
works. Tabari111 for instance has mentioned the blood money
clauses. Ibn Sa'd112 has spoken of blood money between the
believers, that no one in debt should be left unaided, and that a
believer should not be killed in retaliation of a disbeliever. 'AbdurRazzaq San'ani113 has, tracing his report to Zuhri, reported that
blood money was the responsibility of the tribe and that this report
reached them from the Prophet #§ as found in the document
between the Quraysh and Ansar. It said, "Don't leave anyone

107 Sunan An-Nasa'i (8/20). In his chain there are two reliable narrators —
Muhammad bin Abdul-Wahid, and Abu Hassan. And the report has
supporting evidences in the Sahihayn, therefore it is Sahih li Ghayrihi as
said Harun, (p. 167).
10*See Sahih Sunan Ibn Majah-Albani (2/101/H. 2659) who called it HasanSahih.
109 Ibid, H. 2660, and Albani^said it is Sahih.

burdened except that he should be released of captivity or payment
of blood money. Muqrizi114 has said that the Prophet #§ got written
a treaty with the Jewish tribes Banu Qaynuqa', Banu Nadir and
Banu Qurayzah. Ibn Hazm115 has said that the Prophet

made

treaties with the Jews and Diyar Bakri.116 He added that he allowed
them to follow their religion, promising them the safety of their life
and property, while making it conditional that they would not help
anyone against him and if someone surprised him with an attack
they should be on the Prophet's side.
Ibn Marduwayh117 reported while speaking of the Banu Nadir,
"He arranged his forces early in the morning and laid siege to them.
Then he proceeded to the Banu Qurayzah and besieging them also.
They renewed their pledge. So he left them and went back to Banu
Nadir and besieged them until they agreed to leave Madinah..."
This report is very clear about the Prophet's treaties with the
Banu Qurayzah which was, as the above report suggests, a renewal
of the previous one.
Harun118 has traced several portions that fall here and there in
the Sahih books of Ahadith (traditions). As for Qur'anic Verses, he
mentioned some twenty-seven Verses that corroborate bits and
pieces in Sahih works.
In short, the entire contents of the document is corroborated
either by the Qur'an or the Hadith. If not for the fear of volume, we
would have mentioned a few more. May Allah reward Harun well.
As regards those clauses of the treaties that speak of peace with
the pagans and Jews —without any tribute payable by them— those
clauses were abrogated by the Qur'an. It said,

114 See Imta'ul-Asma' (1/49) without a chain, so it is weak.
1 l?See Jaivami'us-Sirah, p. 95, without a chain.
IUlSee Tarikhul-Khamis fi Ahwali Anfus Nafis (1/353).
117 It was mentioned by Ibn Hajar in Al-Fath (15/202 in ch. Maghazi) and
remarked that its chain is trustworthy. It was also recorded by 'AbdurRazzaq in Musannaf (5/359-360); Abu Dawud in his Sunan, and Bayhaqi
in his Dala'il (3/198).

"Fight those who do not believe in Allah nor in the Judgement
Day and do not declare unlawful what Allah and His Messenger
declared unlawful, refusing to accept the true religion - until
they pay tribute with their hands, humbled/'119
This was revealed in the 9th year after Hijrah.120 It is accepted
by all that Surat Al-Tawbah is the last chapter to be revealed as stated
by Bukhari.121

Lessons
(a) This document is considered to be one of the most ancient
written constitutions.
(b) Scholars have not mentioned that any of the clauses were
abrogated except for the peace treaties with the pagans and
Jews without tribute. That was abrogated by the Verse of Surat

Al-Tawbah mentioned above.
(c) Some scholars have said that the several treaties with the Jews
corroborate with a Quranic Verse which says.

"Allah does not prevent you against those who do not fight
against you in your religion and did not banish you from your
homes, that you should be good and virtuous towards them and
deal with them injustice. Surely, Allah approves of the just."122

A few other clauses of constitution can also be worked out from
the above document. In fact, the above points allow for further
expansion of Islamic rulings. And, except for those clauses that
apply especially to Muslims,123 the above principles are found in
every constitution including those written by humans124 (that is,
those not based on revelation).
Nonetheless, despite the above generosity and comprehensive
attitude in dealing with the Jews, they betrayed the Muslims and
responded with machinations against Islam in a variety of ways, as
we shall see when we unfold the rest of their account. One of the
frontiers that they opened, and to which the historians paid scant
attention, is that of polemics, hoping to frustrate the expansion of
the new message and prevent people from Allah's path. That was
done without the intention to embrace Islam even if its several
aspects proved satisfactory. The Qur'an recorded their polemics.
Those who played the leading role were: Rafi' bin Huraymilah,
Sallam bin Mishkam, Nu'man bin Awfa, Mahmud bin Dihyah, Shas
bin Qays, Malik bin Sayf, Jabal bin Abu Qushayr, Shamwil, Nu'man
Ahna', Bahri bin 'Amr, Shash bin 'Adi, Rafi' bin Harithah, Naham
bin Zayd, Kurdam bin Ka'b, and others.

Various Events

Naming Yathrib as Taybah, Tabah and Al-Madinah

In the documents discussed above, Madinah had been
mentioned as Yathrib. But, the Prophet «|| didn't like the name
and subsequently got it changed to Taybah, Tabah and Al-Madinah.
Muslim has reported that the Prophet ^ said, "Allah has named
Madinah as Tabah." Muslim also reports his words, "It is Taybah,
meaning Madinah. It expels filth as fire (separates and) throws out
dirt from the silver."1 Tayalisi2 has also reported, "They used to call
the city Yathrib until the Prophet

named it Taybah."

Ibn Hajar3 has reported through Abu Sahl bin Malik, through
Ka'b Ahbar who said, "We find in Allah's Book that He revealed to
Musa that Allah called it Taybah and Tabah." Some narrations have
reported a different name such as Al-Madinah. Bukhari4 reported
through Abu Hurayrah 4® that "angels are on Madinah's borders

not letting in plague and Dajjal." Ahmad has another report.3 It
says, "Whoever called the city Yathrib may seek Allah's forgiveness.
It is Tabah, it is Tabah." Suyuti6 has Ibn 'Abbas & saying that the
Prophet

said, "Don't call it Yathrib for it is Taybah, iae., Madinah.

Whoever said Yathrib may seek Allah's forgiveness thrice. It is
Taybah, Taybah, Taybah."
Bukhari7 has Abu Humayd saying, "When we were returning
from Tabuk and the city of Madinah came into sight, the Prophet jyg
remarked, "This is Tabah." Ibn Shabbah8 has reported Abu Ayyub
that Madinah may not be referred to as Yathrib. Muslim9 has Abu
Hurayrah's report that the Prophet

said, "I am commanded to

seek the town that will eat away the (surrounding) villages. It is
called Yathrib, but it is Madinah. It expels the (wrong) people as a
melting pot removes off the scum from iron." The Qur'an called it
Madinah in several places.10 Ibn Hajar11 has speculated about why

See Al-Musnad (4/285) where the Hadith is attributed to Bara' bin 'Azib.
The narrators therein are men that have been relied on except for Yazid
bin Abu Ziyad who was weak, as stated in At-Taqrib (3/365) and AfTahdhib. However, it is strengthened by other corroborative material. Ibn
Hajar also mentioned it in Al-Fath (18/216), as was also reported by
Haythami in Al-Majma' (3/300) who ascribed it to Abu Ya'la and that its
narrators are trustworthy. Ibn Shabbah narrated through three chains in
Tarikhul-Madinah (1/164-165). First of them is Disconnected (Mursal) in
which is Yazid bin Abu Ziyad, second is Traceable (Marfa") in chain, but
once again we have Yazid bin Abu Ziyad in it, and third is also Marfa'
whose narrators are trustworthy but for Ibn Abu Yahya — Ibrahim bin
Muhammad Aslami but he was abandoned as stated in At-Taqrib. Thus
the Hadith is quite weak.
Ad-Durr Al-Manthur (5/188), who ascribed it to Ibn Marduwayh.
Al-Fath (8/218/H. 1872), it was also reported by Ibn Shabbah in TarikhulMadinah (1/164).
Tarikhul-Madinah (1/165) with a weak chain, because it includes Ibn Abu
Yahya —Ibrahim bin Muhammad Aslami who was abandoned as stated in
At-Taqrib. Thus his Hadith is very weak. But there are supportive reports
through which it gathers strength.

10 Other examples are: Surat Al-Mutiafiqun: 8, Surat Al-Ahzab: 60, Surat AtTawbalv. 101,120. It has been the topic at several places in the Noble Qur'an.

the town may not be called Yathrib because either Yathrib has its
linguistic root in Yathrib which means 'reproach' or in Ath-Tharb
which means 'corruption.' Both of them do not sound good. The
Prophet
approved of good names and disapproved of evil
sounding ones.
Illnesses that struck Some of the Muhajir
Some of the Companions faced illnesses upon arrival at
Madinah. They were struck by the Yathrib12 fever until some of
them were offering prayers from the sitting position. Allah ($g)
preserved the Prophet ^ from it.13 However, Abu Bakr and Bilal
were struck. When Abu Bakr
was feverish he would sing out the
lines,
"Even/one wakes up among his people
While death is nearer to him than his shoe-lace."
When Bilal

was sick he would raise his voice and say:

"Shall I ever again spend a night at Fakh
With sweet herbs and thyme around me?
With the dawn when I come down to the waters of Majanna
Shall I ever see Shamah and Tafil again?"
(Translation based on A. Guillaume's)
' Aishah ^ reported to the Prophet
what the two were saying.
He said, "O Allah, endear to us Madinah the way You endeared us
Makkah, or more. Make it healthier and bless its weights and
measures. Transfer its fever to Juhfah."14
12 Part of a narration in Ahmad: Al-Fathur-Rabbani (21/31-32). Sa'ati said:
"Haythami recorded it in its fuller form pointing out that Ahmad and
Bazzar have reported it with. He also said that Ahmad's narrators are
trustworthy except for Harithah bin Mudarrib, and he too was
reliable."

13 Ahmad: Musnad (3/136); Ibn Ishaq through a chain that does not declare
personal hearing of the report — Ibn Hisham (2/274); Ibn Majah (1/388/H.

reliable."
14 Al-Bukhdri/Al-Fath (15/121-122/H. 3926). Ibn Hajar said in explanation, "In

The Prophet of Islam

372

'Aishah V5 herself fell ill along with Ibn Fuhayrah"’ as well as
others. Yathrib was famous for its fever so that when the Muslims
went to Makkah for 'Utnrah, the pagans said about them, "A people
are to enter who have been weakened by the Yathrib fever.” That
was the reason why the Prophet ^ ordered the Muslims to walk
straight, and throw out their chests to demonstrate their strength
and show the pagans that fever had not weakened them as much as
they imagined.17 Allah (M) answered the Prophet's prayer and
converted the town into one of the best ones.

Quraysh threaten the Muhdjir and the Ansar
'Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul was the most prominent of chiefs
of Madinah. Just before the Prophet ^ arrived, the Madinans had
decided on crowning him king and prepared a crown of pearls for
that function. But, with the Prophet's arrival, that didn't happen. So
the man delayed to announce his allegiance to Islam. He felt that the
Prophet
had deprived him of his crown. Therefore, even after he
officially announced his Islam, he bore grudge for the Prophet 2^.
The strategy that he employed to conceal his enmity was hypocrisy.
Several incidents lend credence to the theory as the following
shows.
One such incident is the report in Al-Bukhdri,18 Muslimig and
Musnad Ahmad,20 coming through Sa'd bin 'Ubadah. He told the

a valley" i.e., Makkah. See Al-Fathur-Rabbdni (21/13-14). Shamah and Tafil
are two mountains near Makkah. Some say two springs. This Hadith was
reported by Ibn Ishaq with a Hasan chain—Ibn Hisham (2/271-273).
15

Al-Bukhari/Al-Fath (15/114/H. 3918).

16 Ibn Ishaq mentioned this; being a Hadith of 'Aishah & through a Hasan
chain—Ibn Hisham (2/271), and Ahmad: Al-Fathur-Rabbdni (21/13) —a
Hadith by 'Aishah about which Sa'ati said, "Accepted by the Shaykhayti.”

Al-Bukhari/Al-Fath (16/96/H. 4256, 4257). We have pointed out that Bilal

to the land of diseases.

Prophet
"O Messenger of Allah. Forgive him and excuse him. By
Him who revealed the Book to you —surely Allah has sent the truth
with you —the people of this town had unanimously agreed to
crown him king. But when Allah disapproved of it by sending the
revelation upon you, he felt defeated and, consequently you see him
behaving the way he does."
According to Jbn Ishaq,21 Sa'd said, "O Messenger of Allah. Be
indulgent of him. By Allah, Allah has brought you to us while we
were making arrangements- to crown him king. He feels that you
have deprived him of his kingship."
The Makkans found their own image in the person of Ibn Salui.
He was in truth on their religion. They wrote to him to plan things
and prepare himself to play his role against the Prophet sg and his
men, as they had played their role in Makkah. They wrote to him,
"You have given refuge to our man. We swear by God that either
you fight him, expel him or we shall come down on you to capture
your women."
Ibn Ubaiy began to act to orders. He gathered the disbelievers
of Madinah to coax them for a fight against the Prophet sg. When
the Prophet jg learnt of it, he went forth and addressed them in
the following words, "Quraysh threats seem to have had greater
effects on you than they should. But the fact is, they intend to do
greater mischief to you than you realize. They wish you to fight
against your own sons and brothers." With those words they
dispersed.22
The Quraysh also wrote to the Muslims, "Don't be under the
impression that you have found a safe sanctuary in Madinah. We
will come down there, uproot and destroy you right in the middle of
your dwellings."23
The Quraysh threats forced the Muslims to stand guard over the
Prophet >g until Allah
revealed,

"Allah will guard you against the people."24
When that was revealed he addressed them, "People. Go
away. Allah has promised to guard me,"25 although he had earlier,
in fear of his life, asked Sad bin Abu Waqqas to stand guard over
him.26
It was not only the Prophet $gg who was in danger. It extended
to his Companions. Ubaiy bin Ka'b said, "When the Prophet
and
his Companions arrived at Madinah and the Ansar sheltered them,
the Arabs became one body against them. Those days the Muslims
slept with arms under their pillows, carrying them around during
the day."27
One of the ways in which the Quraysh demonstrated their
seriousness was to prevent the Ansar from visiting the Holy
Mosque at Makkah. We have before us the incident involving Sa'd
bin Mu'adh and Abu Jahl. Here is in brief the story from Bukhari:
Sa'd b. Mu'adh went to Makkah to visit the House. He asked his
host Umaiyah bin Khalaf to stand watch while he circumambu¬
lated the House. Umaiyah took him to the House at noontime
hoping to encounter none of the Quraysh. But, as it should
happen, Abu Jahl passed by. He asked Umaiyah about the man in
his company and Umaiyah informed him who he was. Abu Jahl
taunted Sa'd, "Will you go around the Holy House in peace
despite having given shelter to Muhammad and his Companions?"
Sa'd replied, "By Allah, if you prevent me from circumambulating
the House, I shall cut your trade route to Sham." He also promised
him that the Prophet
would kill him. And, truly, Abu Jahl was
killed at Badr.28

Military and Political Activities

Permission to retaliate
Ibn Jarir29 has reported Ibn 'Abbas 4k, as having said, “When the
Prophet

left Makkah, Abu Bakr remarked, 'They have expelled

their Messenger. That's not good. They will be destroyed/ and Allah
(3g) revealed,
yjjd

JLv-ai

4li olJ LAkT- p-gJ>l

"Permitted (to retaliate) are those who are attacked. That is
because they have been wronged. And, surely, Allah is able to
help them.''30
When Abu Bakr heard of the Verse he remarked, 'I knew that there
would be fights.Ahmad has added31 another sentence of Ibn
'Abbas, “This was the first Verse allowing Muslims to fight." 'Awfi
has said that this Verse was revealed when the disbelievers expelled
the Prophet

and his Companions from Makkah.32

Obviously, Jihad was instituted at the appropriate time. In
Makkah Muslims were very small in numbers in comparison to the
non-Muslims. But when the Muslims had begun to settle in
Madinah — after their forced migration, earlier to Abyssinia and
later to Madinah, and when they found a shelter in Madinah, Allah
(■31) allowed that Jihad be launched.33 Nonetheless, fighting was still

reported by Tirmidhi: Sahih Sunan At-Tirmidhi (3/179/H. 2535) where
Albani said it is Hasan.
32 See Tafsir Al-Tabari (17/122-123), and Tafsir Ibn Kathir (5/350-431).
33 See Tafsir Ibn Kathir (5/431432). Zuhri said: "The first Verse to be revealed
in connection with retaliation was —as 'Urwah told me on the authority of
'Aishah A: "Permission (to retaliate) is granted to those who are fought
against." Recorded by Nasa'i (6/4) through a reliable chain as said Ibn
Hajar in Al-Fath (15/142). Others also documented it. See Siratush-Shamiyah
(4/12).

not mandatory. Only retaliation was sanctioned if the Muslims were
attacked. Subsequently, it was declared an obligation by the Verse,

'And fight in Allah's path those who fight you.''34
Subsequently, war against all the pagans was made mandatory
with the words,

And fight all of the pagans as they all fight against you."35
Thus, the commandments pertaining to ]ihad were revealed in
four stages:
(a) The stage of forbearance: no retaliation.
(b) The stage in which retaliation was allowed. This happened
after Hijrah.
(c) The stage in which they were allowed to begin a battle
against those who had already declared war against them.
(d) The stage in which they were required to wage a war against
all the pagans.36

35 Surat Al-Tawbah: 36.
36 See Zadul-Ma'ad (3/71) and Sayyid Qutb: Fi Zilalul-Qur'an (3/1431-1432)
Sayyid Qutb has some very important notes to offer on these stages that
Ibn Qaiyim had discussed. With regard to the techniques and approach
that have to be adopted by Islamic movements, there are some original
and important characteristics that have been laid down by him. The very
first and foremost characteristic is that it deals with the real situation
prevailing in real life with realism. He writes, "... This then is a movement
which faces a real human situation ... which faces real situations with
means that match the problems ... It confronts the (modem) Jahiliyyah of
beliefs and ideas: those upon which rest the new, real, practical systems
that support the material power. Islamic movement confronts this new
reality with everything that can stand up against it ... It confronts it with
invitation, and explanations that endeavor to correct the beliefs and ideas

Before Badr

Military Excursions

377

and Other Events before Badr

(I) Objectives of the Military Excursions

When Allah (3g) allowed the Muslims to retaliate force with
force, they began to prepare themselves to face the Quraysh and
others who had shown all readiness to attack. When the Quraysh
wished to show Muslims that they could reach at them in Madinah,
the Muslims gave them to believe that they were not as weak as they
had imagined. They impressed on them that they were in a position
to reply to force with force, and put them under economic and
political siege in order to get back the wealth and properties that the
Quraysh had seized from them when they had migrated.
To translate the above into action, the Muslims first decided to
monitor the trade routes running around them in all directions. The
Prophet 5|| adopted two parallel strategies. First, he sent scouts to
patrol around to harass the passing Quraysh trade caravans.
Second, he prevented the Quraysh from entering into any defense
or offense pacts with the tribes around Madinah. He won over to his
side the tribes of Banu Damrah, Juhaynah, Khuza'ah, Ghifar and
Aslam. We shall have more to say about them a little later. The
Prophet
however did not stop there. He went on expanding his
area of influence, as later events will show.
All the military expeditions that he organized those days
achieved their objectives, especially in weakening the Quraysh and
her allies. He also administered blows to their trade, means of
political influences, and military preparations. Muslim effectiveness
to retaliate whenever necessary was well demonstrated. Obviously,

as it also uses power and force to weaken the systems upon which rest
the powers those powers that come in between the masses on the one
hand, and, on the other, the correction in beliefs, opinions and ideas; those
powers that humbles theunasses through terror and misguidance and lead
them to worship other than their Magnificent Lord..."
37 The historian gave the nomenclature Sariyah to a small Muslim military
force led by a leader, while they used Ghazwah for a fighting force led by
the Prophet #g.

The Prophet of Islam

378

it was also a means to increase the fighting experience of the
believers, practicing maneuvers, measuring the strength of the
opposing forces, and understanding the routes among the
surrounding vales, gorges and plain deserts.

(II) Military Expeditions

(a) Expedition called Sifil-Bahr
This was launched under the leadership of Hamzah bin 'AbdulMuttalib. The force was thirty-men strong. They were to intercept
the Quraysh caravan returning from Sham. The caravan numbered
300 including men such as Abu Jahl. When the two forces met and a
battle was about to ensue, Mijdi bin 'Amr Juhani intervened and the
clash was avoided. This was in Ramadan, in the seventh month after
Hijrah.38
This should tell us something about the usefulness of the treaty
that the Prophet ^ had worked out with one of the Juhaynah tribes
early after his arrival at Madinah. What strengthens this is the report
in Ahmad39 through Sa'd bin Abu Waqqas which says, "When the
Prophet j|| arrived at Madinah, a Juhaynah delegation arrived and
said, 'You have stepped down here amongst us. We want to be sure
that you will not be hostile to us.' So the Prophet ^ drew a treaty
and they began to embrace Islam."
History has preserved some details of other treaties that the

38 Waqidi (1/9), Ibn Sa'd (2/6), Ibn Ishaq — Ibn Hisham (2/281) —all without a
chain. Ibn Sa'd said (2/6): "The Prophet #, did not send anyone of the
Ansar (to a battle) until the battle of Badr. That is because the condition to
which the Ansar had agreed was they would protect him within the
boundaries of Madinah.
39 Al-Musnad (3/70/Shakir). Shakir said its chain is weak because of its
discontinuity. Bayhaqi however documented a similar Hadith in Ad-Dala'il
(3/15) which has a Complete (Mausul) chain. That narration does not
speak of the arrival of Juhaynah. Ibn Kathir said about it in Al-Bidayah (3/
272), "This sounds more correct."

Before Badr

379

Prophet #g entered into with the tribes of Juhaynah. One of them is
in Ibn S'ad.40 It says that the Prophet ^ wrote down a document for
Banu Zur'ah and Banu Dub'ah of Juhaynah. It was to the effect that
they and their properties shall be safe from Muslim attack and that
they shall receive help if attacked, unless the fight (between them
and their adversaries) was of religious nature. Further, the
document promised that it would extend to those of the desertdwellers around them who were upright. The political nature of the
above treaty should be apparent from the exclusion of conflicts of
religious nature.41
' - •
As for the pact he got written for Banu Huraqah and Banu
Jurmuz of the Juhaynah tribes, which bore the name of 'Amr bin
Ma'bad Juhani, it stressed religious obligations as a condition for
peace. It also speaks of the division of war booty, the Prophet's
share in it, unlawfulness of interest on loans,42 and other such
clauses that lead us to believe that it was written after Badr, for rules
pertaining to state share in war booty (Khumus) were revealed after
Badr when the Muslims had grown strong, had defeated the
Quraysh and were somewhat free to impose Islamic power over
Arabia.43 As we know, usury was disallowed in stages. During
Makkan stay, it was revealed in this connection.

"And whatever you give for usury to increase within wealth of
the people will not increase with Allah. But what you give in
Zakat, desiring the countenance of Allah those are the multi¬
pliers."44
Then in Madinan period it was added,

40 At-Tabaqat (1/270) — without a chain.
41 See: Diplomasiyyatu Muhammad, p. 43.
42 At-Tabaqat (1/271-272), without chain.

"Believers, do not consume usury, doubled and multiplied, but

"Believers! Fear Allah and give up (claims to) outstanding

notice of war from Allah and His Messenger. However, if you
repent then you may have your principal, (so that) neither you
wrong (others) nor are wronged (by them)."46
Similarly, the Prophet ^ wrote down two pacts, one for
' Awsajah bin Harmalah Juhani and the other for Banu Shankh of the
Juhaynah tribe, promising both the safety of places and routes
around their dwellings. The two pacts speak of nothing else except
safety of passage.47

(b) Sa'd bin Abu Waqqas's Expedition to Kharrar48

Waqidi49 has preserved a report coming through Sa'd to whom
the Prophet ^ said, '"Go forth Sa'd until Kharrar. A Quraysh
caravan is about to pass by that place.' Accordingly, I marched out

ourselves during the day and marching at night. We reached the
place on the fifth day only to discover that the Quraysh caravan had
left a day earlier. Hadn't the Prophet ^ asked us not to go beyond
Kharrar, I would have given them a chase."
Ibn Sa'd51 has it however that the standard bearer was Miqdad
bin 'Amr and that it was in Dhul-Qa'dah, the ninth month after

Hijrah.52

(c) Expedition to Abwa' (Waddan)
The Prophet #| himself participated in this expedition. It took
place in Safar, eleven months after the Hijrah if we are to go by
Waqidi but twelve according to Ibn Sa'd. The Prophet s|| wished to
harass another Quraysh caravan going up to Banu Damrah. He kept
marching until he reached Abwa' which was the territory of Banu
Damrah. He did not encounter any enemy. But he used the occasion
to enter into an understanding with Banu Damrah, who were of
Kinanah, that they would not attack him nor would help any of his
enemies. A document was written down for their leader Mahshi bin
'Amr Damri.53 This was the first time that the Prophet

had gone

out in an expedition in person.54

(d) 'Ubaydah bin Harith's Expedition to Rabigh
The Prophet j|| appointed 'Ubaydah bin Harith as the leader
over some sixty riders from the Muhajir. He kept marching until he

encountered a huge Quraysh battalion led by Abu Sufyan and
'Ikrimah. They faced each other across the waters of Hijaz and some
skirmishes took place. Sa'd shot an arrow at them. It is said that this
was the first arrow ever shot in the history of Islam. However, soon
they both retreated. Two of pagan forces defected to the Muslims:
Miqdad bin 'Amr and 'Utbah bin Jabir Mazini. They were Muslims
but had accompanied the pagans with the intention to make it to
Muslims if they could.55 This was the major achievement of this
expedition.
Differences remained among historians over the date of this
expedition. Waqidi and Ibn Sa'd have it that it took place in
Shawwal, the eighth month after Hijrah. This should explain
Miqdad bin 'Amr's presence as the head of the later Kharrar
expedition. However, Ibn Ishaq gives us to understand that it took
place in Rabi'ul-Awwal and after the expedition of Abwa'. He does
not state though, the date of the expedition. Abul-Aswad and Ibn
'A'idh are sure that it took place after Abwa' and before the Prophet
*|§ could return from that expedition. Ibn Hajar56 says, "AbulAswad has traced it in his Maghazi through 'Urwah. And Ibn 'A'idh
has recorded the report of Ibn 'Abbas that when the Prophet #£
reached Abwa' he sent 'Ubaydah bin Harith along with sixty men.
They encountered a large Quraysh battalion and a few arrows were
shot. Sa'd shot the first arrow on that occasion."
If this report is reliable57 then perhaps what Abul-Aswad and
Ibn 'A'idh say is to be accepted. But that leaves us with the problem
of Miqdad carrying the flag on the occasion of Kharrar expedition.
We might say to reconcile that it could have been during another
expedition and that Ibn Sa'd is not accurate.56

55 At-Tabaqdt (2/7), Al-Waqidi (1/10), Ibn Ishaq — Ibn Hisliam {2/276) all of
them without a chain and we know that a report that has no chain
belongs to the weak class.
56 Al-Fath (15/142).
^ The final opinion over the chains of Abul-Aswad and Ibn 'A'idh can only
be passed after knowing the whole of the string, which has not been
accomplished yet.

383

(e) Buwat Expedition by the Prophet
The Prophet s|s marched out with two hundred men chasing
another Quraysh caravan headed by Umaiyah bin Khalaf over a
hundred men and two thousand camels. He reached a place called
Buwat. This is a series of mountains in the Juhaynah territory
coming down across Radwa. He did not encounter the caravan and
no fighting took place. This was in Rabi'ul-Awwal, 13 months after

Hijrah.59

(f) Safawan Expedition (Badr-1)
When Kurz bin Jabir Fihri attacked Madinan cattle in Rabi'ulAwwal, thirteen months after Hijrah, the Prophet s|| went out chasing
him as far as the Safawan valley near Badr. However, he missed him.60
According to Ibn Ishaq,61 this took place after the expedition called
'Ushayrah.

(g) The 'Ushayrah Expedition
The Prophet ^ left Madinah with a hundred and fifty to two
hundred men intending to intercept a Quraysh caravan heading for
Sham. He reached 'Ushayrah which was Banu Mudlij territory,
coming down from Yanbu'. Nevertheless, he missed this caravan
too. Later, he tried to intercept the caravan on its return journey, but
he failed in that attempt and, in consequence the Badr battle took
place.
In this journey he entered into treaties with Banu Mudlij and
their allies of the Banu Damrah before returning to Madinah
without a fight having taken place.
This was in Jumada Ath-Thaniyah, sixteen months after Hijrah.62

without a chain.

Sahih compilations also mention this expedition, but do not give
details.63
The sources tell us, however, that the Prophet jp entered into
various defense treaties with the surrounding tribes in his early days
at Madinah, without waiting to go out into an expedition and then
working out the treaty. For example, he wrote a letter to Budayl bin
Warqa', Yusr, and Sarawat of Banu 'Amr of the Khuza'ah,
reminding them that he had remained faithful to the treaty since
its making and that he was herewith reconfirming it.64
He also wrote to Aslam of the Khuza'ah affirming the
agreement of mutual help. Then there was the letter to Banu Ghifar
which spoke of the agreement to defend each other if attacked by a
third party. Again, he also wrote to Nu'aym bin Mas'ud bin
Rakhilah Ashja'i which mentioned the mutual defense pact and
carried some admonition.65

(h) The Nakhlah Expedition
The Prophet sp sent 'Abdullah bin Jahsh long with eight of the
Immigrants in Rajab, the seventeenth month after Hijrah with a
letter which was to be opened after two days of journey. This was to
keep their destination in dark. When the letter was opened after two
days journey, it said that he was to go along until he reached
Nakhlah between Makkah and Ta'if.66 He was to however give his
companions a choice to return if anyone so wished. All of them
agreed to continue.
When they reached Nakhlah, they came across a small band of
Quraysh men in which were Ibn Hadrami, 'Uthman bin 'Abdullah

Waqidi (1/12-13), all without a chain. Waqidi has the textual difference in
Dhul-'Ushayrah. But what is in the Sahih is more correct.
63 See Al-Bukhdri/Al-Fath (15/141-144/H. 3949, chapter, Ghazwah Al-'Ushayrah).
64 See Usdul-Ghabah by Ibn Athir (1/170) and Ibn Sa'd (1/272).
65 See Ibn Sa'd: At-Tabaqdt (1/271-274).
66 This shows that the Muslims plan to watch Quraysh caravans was not
restricted to the north, but rather it covered the south also, which had the
route leading Quraysh caravans to Yemen.

385

bin Mughirah, his brother Nawfal, and Hakam bin Kaysan the
freed slave of Hisham bin Mughirah. The Companions discussed
among themselves their course of action. They were in the last day
of Rajab which is one of the consecrated months. On the other
hand, they felt that if they let go the opportunity, the next day the
Quraysh party would enter into the safe area and they would not
be able to attack them. So, finally they decided to attack. Waqid
bin 'Abdullah Tamimi

shot an arrow

and killed 'Amr bin

Hadrami. They also managed to take 'Uthman bin 'Abdullah bin
Mughirah and Hakam bin-Kaysan as prisoners. Nawfal escaped.
'Abdullah bin Jahsh and his men returned with their prisoners to
the Prophet #§ at Madinah.
However, the Prophet

reminded them that he had not asked

them to fight in the holy month. He also refused to accept the two
prisoners. The participants of the expedition were also criticized by
other Companions and they thought destruction had befallen them.
As expected, the Quraysh spread the propaganda that Muhammad
and his men were desecrating the holy months, killing, taking
prisoners and collecting booty. When the propaganda intensified,
Allah ($g) revealed the Verse,

"They inquire you (O Prophet) concerning figh ting in the sacred
month. Tell them, 'Fighting therein is (a) grave (offense); but to
bar from the way of Allah, disbelief in Him, and in the Holy
Mosque and expelling its people from it-are all (crimes of)
greater (dimension) in the sight of Allah. And persecution is
worse than slaughter. (You may cease fighting them O Muslims,

The Prophet of Islam

386

but) they will never cease fighting you until they have turned you
back from your religion — if they are able. But whosoever turns
back from his religion, and dies in the state of disbelief it is such
whose works will go waste both in this life as well as the next.
These are the people of the Fire. They shall abide in it forever. (In
contrast) surely, those who believed, and those who left their
homes (for strange lands) and fought in the way of Allah, it is
such who (rightly) hope to win Allah's Mercy. And Allah is very
Forgiving, very Kind."67
With that the expedition participants felt relieved and the
Prophet j|§ accepted the prisoners and the booty. Later, when the
Quraysh sent redemption money for the two prisoners, the Prophet
s|§ delayed accepting it from fear of Sa'd bin Abu Waqqas and
'Utbah bin Ghazwan falling into Quraysh hands. They had fallen
behind their companions during the same expedition in search of a
camel that they had lost.68

Lessons
1.

The Verses that came down in reference to the Nakhlah
expedition tell us in clear terms that fighting in the consecrated
months, committed by the Muslims, was less serious with Allah
than the Quraysh expelling the Muslims from Makkah,
confiscating their property and preventing them from entering
into the Grand Mosque. If the pagans committed these crimes, it

67 Surat Al-Baqaralv. 217-218. The sacred months are: Dhul-Qa'dah, DhulHijjah, Muharram and Rajab, as noted by Bukhari. See Al-Fath (17/204205, H. 4662).
6X Tabarani documented the story of this expedition as Ibn Hajar mentioned
in Al-Isabah (2/278) with a Connected (Muttasil) chain. Haythami said in
Al-Majma' (6/66-67): "Tabarani recorded through a single chain which
happens to be Hasan." Ibn Ishaq reported through a Disconnected (Mursal)
chain which stopped at 'Urwah—Ibn Hisham (2/288-293). Ibn Kathir said
in Al-Bidayah (3/274): "We have mentioned in our Tafsir the various
supportive narrations that Ibn Ishaq used. One of them is the one that Ibn
Abu Hatim reported..." See Tafsir Ibn Kathir (1/368-369).

387

was rightful of Muslims to retaliate, even during the conse¬
crated months. The Verses in question confirmed the human
and spiritual values because of which fighting in the holy
month was not to be started without provocation.
2.

The Verses also pointed out that some people resort to the
heavenly laws when it suits them to do so but overlook them
when the situation is otherwise.

3.

The Verses also said that there was to be no complaisance with
the pagans, no matter what the short or long term con¬
sequences.

4.

The Prophet's manner of keeping the expedition destination
secret tells us a lot about adopting the means necessary in wars.
The rest of the world was late to learn this from the Prophet |g.

5.

The Nakhlah incident was the first of its kind so close to
Makkah, the center of pagan power. (It demonstrated their
vulnerability — Translator). It also spoke of the readiness for
sacrifice on the part of those who participated in it, none of
whom returned when given the choice.69

(j) Change in the Qiblah

The great majority of scholars believe that it was in the middle of
Sha'ban, eighteen months after the Hijrah70 that Allah (Si)
commanded the Muslims to change the direction of orientation
during prayers from Baytul-Maqdis to Masjid Al-Haram. Until then
they were facing the ‘Baytul-Maqdis in their prayers. The Prophet
himself was desirous that the Qiblah (prayer direction) be changed to
that of Ibrahim, praying for it fervently. Allah (Si) revealed,

The first prayer done facing the new Qiblah was that of the
Afternoon prayer ('Asr).73 The Quba' people came to know of it only
on the next day while they were in their Fajr prayers.74

(k) Ramadan Fasts

Tabari75 has noted the following as one of those events that took
place in the second year after Hijrah. He writes, "In this year the
Ramadan fasts were declared obligatory. Some say it was declared
obligatory in Sha'ban of this year."
Reports in Al-Bukhdri and Muslim76say that when the Prophet
HI arrived at Madinah, he learned that the Jews fasted on the day of
'Ashura. So, he too fasted on that day urging others to follow his
example. When Ramadan fasts were made obligatory, the 'Ashura
fast became supererogatory.

The Battle of Badr

When the Prophet jig learnt of Abu Sufyan leading back a
trade caravan to Makkah he told the Muslims: "Here is Abu
Sufyan's trade caravan carrying their wealth. Go after them.
Maybe Allah will grant it to you as booty."1 Abu Ayyub Ansari's
narration says, "The Prophet ^ said while we were in Madinah, 'I
have been informed2 that Abu Sufyan's trade caravan is heading
towards us. Would you like to go after it? Maybe Allah will grant
it to us as a booty/ We said, 'Yes.' So he marched out and we

Reported by Ibn Ishaq through a Good (Hasan) chain — Ibn Hisham (2/295).
It appears to me and Allah knows best that all the stories of Badr are, in
Ibn Ishaq, through this single chain of transmitters, although he does not
repeat the chain for every incident or every passage. This particular report,
in this meaning, can be found in Tafsir At-Tabari (13/398-399) with a
Disconnected (Mursal) chain, for its narrators are sound, stopping at
'Urwah who was onfe of the Followers.

He was told by Busaysah who was sent as a spy for that purpose, as
reported by Muslim (3/1510/H. 1901). Muhammad Fuwad 'Abdul-Baqi
said in the footnote: "(Busaysah) Qadi said: This is how it has been
reported in every copy. He said that what is commonly accepted in
biographies is Basbas, identified as Basbas bin 'Amr. It is also said that he
is Ibn Bishr, one of the'Ansar of the Khazraj tribe. Some say they were
allied to them. I (Imam Nawawi) say that it is possible that one of the
two words is his name and the other nickname." Personally, I don't see
why there couldn't have been an error in reporting the name. See his
biography in Al-Isdbah (2/147), Ibn Sad (2/24), through a Disconnected &
Sound (Mursal-Sahih) report.

went with him."1 * 3
However, the Prophet
did not demand from everyone that
he accompany him. Rather, he asked those whose mounts were
around in the upland of Madinah to give company.4 Therefore, he
did not question anyone who did not respond.5 Their number as
they left was between 313 and 317 of whom6 7 82 to 86 were of the
Muhdjir (Emigrants), 61 of the Aws and 170 of the Khazraj tribe.'
They had a solitary horse and seventy camels whose backs two to
three men shared in turns. Abu Lubabah and 'Ali bin Abu Talib
shared a mount with the Prophet
When his turn came to walk,
they said, "We will walk in your place." He replied, "Neither you
two are stronger than me nor am I any lesser in need of rewards."6

Haythami documented it in Al-Majma' (6/73-74) remarking, "Tabari
reported it with a Hasan chain."

4

A Hadith in Sahih Muslim (3/1510/H. 192); and in Musnad of Ahmad (3/
1360) as a report from Anas 4e. Tabarani reported it in Al-Majma' (6/67).
Haythami remarked, "Its narrators are trustworthy."

5

See the Hadith of Ka'b bin Malik in Al-Bukhari/Al-Fath (16/241/H. 4418).

6

See Al-Bukhari/Al-Fath (15/155-157/H. 3956-3959). The number mentioned
here is "three hundred and a few." The Ansar were about two hundred
and forty and the Muhdjir about sixty. Muslim says (12/84, Nawawi) that
their number was 319 and the polytheists were a thousand. Nasa'i in his
Sunan (2/7) said they were 314. In this chain falls Yahya bin 'Abdullah
who was trustworthy but given to doubts, so his reports maybe written
down for considerations. The correct figure seems to be what Muslim
wrote in explanation of the explanation of "a few" as nineteen, as said
Bawazir (p. 364).

7

This is part of a Hadith documented by Ibn Ishaq in connection with the
Prophet i|| asking the Muslims whether to meet the Quraysh — Ibn Hishdm
(2/295). Al-Bukhari/Al-Fath (15/155/H. 3956) mention that the Muhdjir
were around sixty while the Ansar were around more than two hundred
and forty. See also Ibn Hajar's discussion (15/155 and 197) over the
number of Muhdjir and Ansar at Badr.

See the Hadith in the Musnad (6/3/Shakir). Shakir said its chain is Sahih.
This is also the statement in Al-Majma' who attributed it to Bazzar adding,
"In it falls 'Asim bin Bahdalah and his report is Hasan, as for the rest of
the narrators of Ahmad, they are reliable. Ibn Ishaq too has it with a
Hasan chain — Ibn Hishdm (2/302-303). Hakim documented in his AlMustadrak (3/30) saying, "The report is Sahih on the conditions laid by

The Battle of Badr

When they reached a place called Rawha', the Prophet
returned Abu Lubabah to Madinah, appointing him its governor.
Earlier, he had appointed 'Abdullah bin Umm Maktum to lead in
prayers.9 Marthad bin Abu Marthad10 took Lubabah's place as the
new sharer of the camel along with the Prophet and 'Ali. There is no
contradiction then between the report of Ahmad and Ibn Ishaq who
have reported different partners of the Prophet ^ in this journey.
When Abu Sufyan learnt of the Prophet's moves, he sent
Damdam bin 'Aim Ghifari to Makkah to warn the Quraysh.
Damdam rushed to Makkah and when he entered the town he stood
on the back of his camel, tore his shirt and shouted out, "O Quraysh!
The caravan. The caravan. Your wealth with Abu Sufyan is
threatened by Muhammad. I don't believe you will ever see it.
Help. Help."
In response, the Quraysh came out speedily to help their men
and save their wealth hoping also to meet the Muslims in a battle,
annihilate them and resolve the issue once and for all. Therefore,
none of their chieftains remained behind except for Abu Lahab. He
sent 'As bin Hisham in his own place in return of a loan that was
due from him amounting to 4000 dirhams.* 11 Also, except for the
'Adi tribe,12 no tribe remained without sending some of its men.
They totalled some 1300 fighters at the beginning of the journey, on
a hundred horses, and many camels. Six hundred of them wore coat
of arms. They were led by Abu Jahl.

Muslim." Dhahabi agreed with him.

See Al-Mustadrak (3/632) being a report over which Dhahabi remained
silent because it includes Ibn Lahiy'ah who was treated trustworthy as
stated in At-Taqrib (1/444). Also see Ibn Hisham (2/302) in his additions to
the Sirat but without a chain.

13 Reported by Ibn Kathir in Al-Biddyah (3/284-285) from the Hadith of

392

The Prophet of Islam

When the Quraysh remembered the enmity of Banu Bakr and
that the latter might ambush the Makkans in their absence, they
were almost ready to return when Shaytan (Satan) went to them in
the form of Suraqah bin Malik of the Mudlij tribe, being the chief of
the Kinanah branch. He told them, "I stand guarantee for Kinanah
that they should do anything behind you that is discomforting to
you."14 So they continued, with plenty of pomp and show, as the
Qur'an illustrated.

"Arrogant, and showing off to the people, preventing people from
the way of Allah."15
Meanwhile, 'Atikah bint 'Abdul-Muttalib dreamt three days
before Damdam's arrival that, in her words, "I saw a man arrive at
Abtah saying, 'O people of Badr, leave within three days for the
places of your fall/ Then the caller took a rock and threw it from the
top of a mountain. It began to roll down and break into pieces until
no house was left in which its pieces had not entered." When Abu
Jahl heard of it he quipped addressing 'Abbas, "Is it not enough that
you have a prophet among you, that you should now have a
prophetess also?" There would have been some exchange of hostile
action between 'Abbas and Abu Jahl if not for Damdam's arrival
that engaged Abu Jahl's attention. With his arrival, the Makkans
quickly got ready and left for Badr in fulfillment of ' Atikah's
dream.16

Umawi with a Disconnected (Mursal) chain that stopped at Abu Bakr
Hudhali to the effect that the polytheists had sixty horses.
14 Reported by Ibn Ishaq through a Hasan chain, but it is Mursal since it
comes from 'Urwah — Ibn Hisham (2/301).
15 Surat Al-Anfal: 47. This Verse was mentioned in a Hadith reported by
Tabari in his Tafsir (13/578/Shakir) via a chain that stops at Hisham bin
'Urwah and has its origin in a dispatch sent by 'Urwah bin Zubayr to
'Abdullah bin Marwan. Shakir said, "It is a trustworthy narrative."
16 The narrative speaking of 'Atikah's dream was reported by Ibn Ishaq
through two chains of transmission. The first is Interrupted (Munqati')
because of the unknowability of the first narrator — Ibn Hisham (2/296).

The Battle of Badr

393

Abu Sufyan was ever awake to the problem of Muslim attack.
When he reached Badr, he met Majdi bin 'Amr and sought from him
the news of the Prophet's army. He told him that he had seen two
riders near a mountain. They had watered themselves at a well
nearby and left. Abu Sufyan immediately went to the spot, picked
up some camel-dung, broke it and knew from it that it was fed on
Madinan dates. He returned quickly and veering around to the left
of Badr, took the caravan by the unfrequented seashore route. By
that guile he escaped unmolested. Then he sent a message to the
Quraysh, who were then encamped in Juhfah, informing them of his
escape and advised them to return to Makkah.17
The Makkan army would have all returned but for Abu Jahl
who said, "By God. We shall not return until we have been up to
Badr where we shall camp for three days, slaughter beasts, feed the
people, drink wine, and hold song and dance sessions so that the
Arabs hear of us coming and going and learn never to take us
lightly. So, let's go."18

This was also mentioned by Ibn Hisham (2/296-298). Hakim however
completed the chain in Al-Mustadrak (3/19-20) removing the unkowability
factor. He offered the name of the person who narrated to Ibn Ishaq, viz.,
Husayn bin 'Abdullah. Nevertheless, Dhahabi declared him weak in
Talkhis. The second version is Disconnected (Mursal)-Ibn Hisham (2/296298).
Bayhaqi also documented in his Dald'il (3/103-105) when reporting the
Badr incident, having taken it from Maghazi of Musa bin 'Uqbah, with a
Mursal chain. Tabarani reported it via a Mursal chain that has Ibn
Lahiy'ah who was thought weak but his narratives are Hasan. This is
stated in Al-Majma' (6/69-70). He also recorded through another chain in
which falls 'Abdul-'Aziz bin 'Imran, who was abandoned as a narrator, as
stated in Al-Majma' (6/71-72). Ibn Mandah also preserved it as mentioned
by Ibn Hajar in Al-lsabah (4/357) through a chain that Bawazir declared
weak: Marwiyyat Ghazwat Badr, p. 126. In short, the weakness there is in
the chains of Hakim and Ibn Ishaq is reduced in degree because of the
several narratives of this'nature, raising it to the status of Hasan li Ghayrihi
as stated by Bawazir: Marwiyyat Ghazwat Badr (p. 128, footnote).
17 Reported by Ibn Ishaq being part of a report covering Badr-An Hisham
(2/309-310).
18 Reported by Tabari in his Tafsir (13/579/Shakir) through a Hasan chain.

The Prophet of Islam

Except for Akhnas bin Shariq, the Makkan force obeyed him.
Akhnas returned with his men. Talib bin Abu Talib also returned
because the Quraysh accused Banu Hashim that their sympathy was
in truth with the Prophet

The rest marched on to encamp near

Badr behind the sand dunes at the farther end.19
The Prophet m received news of their march towards Badr and
consulted his men.20 A group of his followers felt that they were not
ready for an abrupt confrontation. They argued their point with the
Prophet #2. Allah (S§) sent down His Words about them.

'As your Lord brought you out of your dwelling with truth,

although a section of the believers was reluctant; arguing with
you concerning the truth after it had become clear, as if they were
being driven to death while they were looking on. When Allah
was promising you one of the two groups that it will be yours,
while you were wishing that the unarmed should be yours, but
Allah was wishing to make true the truth with His Words and
cut off the root of the disbelievers."21

The story was originally a narration of Ibn Ishaq -Ibn Hisham (2/310) via
a chain that Tabari wrote. It may be noted that Tabari mentioned the
whole of Ibn Ishaq's report in this regard as though coming through a
single chain, and Ibn Ishaq himself did not mention the chain at every
phrase, but rather offered notes. I am inclined to accept Tabari's method.
19 From Ibn Ishaq's report on Badr-Ibn Hisham (2/311-312). Banu Zuhra
were around 300 men.

consulting his Companions was briefly
recorded by Bukhari as in Al-Fath (15/151-152/H. 3952); Muslim (3/14031404/H. 1779); Ahmad: Al-Fathur-Rabbani (21/29-30), also in brief; Ibn

march on and confront the Makkans. Miqdad said, "O Messenger of
Allah. Do what Allah shows you as the right thing to do. We shall
not say to you as the Israelites said to Moses, 'Go, you and your
Lord, and fight. We shall remain seated right here.' Rather, we say,
'Go, you and your Lord and fight. We are right with you.' By Him
who sent you, if you went as far as Barkal-Ghimad we shall
accompany you until yqu have reached it."^2 According to another
report his words were, "We. shall not say as the Israelites said to
Musa, 'Go, you and your Lord and fight,' rather, we shall fight by
your right, by your left, from the front and from the rear." His
words pleased the Prophet sg.23
After having heard from the leaders of the Muhajir, the Prophet
sought others' counsel by saying, "People, give me your advice."
He meant of course the Ansar since they were in greater numbers in
his company and the text of the second pledge at 'Aqabah had not
said anything about their defense of the Prophet |g outside the city
of Madinah.24 Sa'd bin Mu'adh, the standard-bearer of the Ansar,
understood what the Prophet |g meant. He got up and said, "By
Allah. It sounds like you intend us to speak out." The Prophet
replied, "Very much so." He said, "Well. We have believed in you
and testified to your Messengership. We also testify that what you
have brought is the Truth. Following these testimonies, we have

Abu Sufyan and the Quraysh army. The Muslims disliked to meet the
armed group as they disapproved of a fight. They were in favor of
encountering the caravan. But Allah wished what He wished. See Tafsir
At-Tabari (13/404) for the cause of revelation of this Verse in reports
through a Disconnected (Mursal) chain coming from Qatadah and (13/403)
through an Interrupted {Munqati') chain and (13/404) through a Mursal
chain coming from Ibn Jurayj, and (13/405) through a Hasan chain as

given you our word of pledge to listen and obey. Therefore, go
ahead, O Messenger of Allah and attempt what you think is right.
By Him Who sent you, if you plunged into the sea, we will also
plunge in after you, and no one will be left behind. We are not at all
fearful of meeting the enemy tomorrow. Indeed, we are patient in
the battlefield and true to our words when we meet our enemies.
Maybe something will ensue of us that will be pleasing to you.
Therefore, march on in the Name of Allah."25
The Prophet ^ was pleased with Sa'd's words. He
congratulated him and said addressing the people, "March on and
be of good cheer. Allah has promised me one of the two groups. By
Allah, I can almost see the places of the enemy's fall."26
As they marched forward, they met a pagan at Wabrah. He was
known for his courage and fighting skills. He wished to fight on the
Prophet's side. He told him, "Return, for we do not seek the help of
the polytheists." The man offered his services a second time at
another place. But the Prophet ^ repeated his words. The man met
him again at Bayda' and offered his services a third time but adding

25 Mentioned by Ibn Ishaq as a Badr report. Muslim's report (3/1404/H.
1779) however states that the one who spoke on behalf of the Ansar was
Sa'd bin 'Ubadah. But actually he did not attend the Badr battle although
given a share. Abu Shaybah reported this Hadith from 'Ikrimah as Hafiz
said in Al-Fath (15/151-152), who added: “It is possible to say that the
Prophet si consulted them twice in connection with the battle of Badr, the
first time in Madinah, while the second one after leaving Madinah." He
also mentioned that according to a report in At-Tabarani, Sa'd bin 'Ubadah
had actually said these words at Hudaybiyah. This seems more likely to
be correct as said by 'Urjun for whose discussions see the Sirat (3/308).
Also see Ibn Kathir also in Al-Biddyah (3/351).
20 Ibn Ishaq reported this consultation -Ibn Hishdm (2/305-306) in a
Suspended (Mu'allaq) form. Ibn Kathir said in Al-Biddyah (3/287-288), “It
has plenty of supportive proofs from different directions, one such being
what Bukhari reported in his Sahih, or Nasa'i, or Ahmad. See the details in
Al-Bukhdri/Al-Fath (15/150-151/H. 3952), Muslim (3/143/H. 1779), Ahmad:
Al-Fathur-Rabbdni (21/29-30), Bayhaqi in his Dald'il (3/34-35), Ibn 'A'idh
through 'Urwah as reported by Ibn Hajar in Al-Fath (15/151); Ibn Abu
Shaybah: Al-Musannaf (14/355-356) and Ibn Marduwayh as mentioned by
Ibn Hajar in Al-Fath (15/151).

that he had embraced Islam. The Prophet ^ allowed him to join
in.

27

When he neared Safra', he sent Basbas bin 'Amr Juhani and
'Adi bin Abu Zaghba' Juhani to Badr to seek the news of Abu
Sufyan's caravan.28 Another report says he himself went out along
with Abu Bakr. They met an old man and asked him the news of the
Quraysh army. The man wished to first know their identity. They
agreed but asked him to reveal his own identity first. Finally, the
man told them that his news was that Muhammad and his men had
left Madinah on such and such a day and, therefore, should be in
such and such a place by now — laying his finger right on the place
where the Muslims were. He also told them that if his news was
correct, Quraysh and their army should be in such and such a place.
Then he asked them their identity. The Prophet j|§ said, “We are
from water," and rode away. The bewildered man gasped, “From
the water! Which water? Of Iraq?"29
The same evening he sent 'Ali, Zubayr, and Sa'd bin Abu
Waqqas along with a few others to gather news of the enemy troops.
They found two men drawing water for the Makkans. They seized
them and brought them to the Prophet #t. He was in prayers. They
began to question the two. They said they were drawing waters for
the Quraysh army. The Muslims wouldn't believe them and didn't
like the answer wishing to hear about Abu Sufyan's caravan. So
they beat them up until they admitted that they were Abu Sufyan's
men. When the Prophet ^ had completed his prayers he told them
that they were beating them when they spoke the truth and sparing
them when delivering a lie. Then he informed them that the
Quraysh army was right behind those sand dunes at the farther end.

27 See the story in Muslim (3/1449-1450/H. 1817). It could be part of the
authentic story of Badr — Ibn Hisham (2/034).
28 This was reported by Itm Ishaq without chain — possibly it is part of a
Hadith of Badr—Ibn Hisham (2/304).
29 Reported by Ibn Ishaq with an Interrupted (Munqati') chain -Ibn Hisham
(2/306-307) for it is one of the narratives of Muhammad bin Yahya bin
Ibn Hibban. He said about him in At-Taqrib, p. 512, “Reliable scholar who
died in the 21st year."

When the Prophet

asked the two about the number of the

Quraysh army, they were unable to answer. However, upon asking,
they revealed that the army slaughtered nine to ten camels a day for
the soldiers. From that the Prophet

worked out that they could be

between 900 and 1000 men. They also revealed details concerning
the chief Qurayshi men that had come along. He remarked,
"Makkah30 has sent across pieces of its heart."31 He then pointed
to the places where the chiefs of them would fall. And, every one of
O'y

them fell right on that spot.
Allah (H) also sent down rains that night, allowing the Muslims
to cleanse and purify themselves. It also helped make the ground
firmer under their feet.33 Allah said.

"(When) He was sending down water from the heaven to cleanse

your hearts, and steady your feet therewith."34' 35
Allah's another blessing on the believers that day was that they
dozed off for a while in a sound sleep. Allah said,

30 See the story in Muslim (3/1404/H. 1779) in which it is stated that the
black boy they took belonged to Bani Hajjaj. Ahmad also mentioned it in
his Musnad (2/193/Shakir); Haythami in Al-Majma' (6/76) who said,
"Ahmad's chain is authentic but for Harithah bin Mudarrib who too was
trustworthy." Ahmad's version says that one of the water-drawer was lost
by them. Ibn Ishaq too has this report — Ibn Hisham (2/307-308) without a
chain which gives the names of the two boys: Aslam belonging to Banu
Hajjaj and Gharid Abu Yasar belonging to Banu 'As bin Sa'eed. Others
have also documented this report, apart from these.
31 This Hadith was reported by Ibn Ishaq.
13 This was reported by Muslim in the battle of Badr.
33 See the story about the rain in Ahmad (2/193/Shakir) as also in Ibn
Ishaq — Ibn Hisham (2/312) without a chain.
34 Surat Al-Anfal: 11.
35 See Ibn Kathir: Al-Biddyah wan-Nihdyah (3/292), and his Tafsir (3/564).

The Battle of Badr

399

"(When) He was causing slumber to overcome you: as an
assurance from Him, and He was sending down water from the
heaven."36
Hence we have a report in Ahmad37 passed on to us by Anas
bin Malik. Abu Talhah said, "The day we arranged ourselves before
the pagans at Badr, we were overtaken by a strong sleep. I was one
of those whose grip on the sword would loosen, then I would
tighten my grip and again it would slip."
On the other hand, Allah weakened the disbelievers by casting
differences between them. Ahmad38 has reported that 'Utbah bin
Rabi'ah began to discourage his tribesmen from fighting. He had
realized that the Muslims would fight to death, dying not without
killing one.39 Abu Jahl taunted him for his chicken-heartedness.
Bazzar40 reports that 'Utbah told his men, "Soon, kin will slaughter

36 From a long Hadith in the Musnad (2/193/Shakir).
37 See about the cause behind the revelation of this Verse that Ibn Kathir
mentioned at places of mention.
38 See Al-Fathur-Rabbdni (21/43).
39 This was known from 'Amr bin Wahb Jumahi who was sent by the
Quraysh to spy on the Muslims. He returned to them and said, "I have
seen, O people, tribulations loaded with destiny. We shall meet the
Yathribites carrying certain death: a people who have no recourse except
to their swords. By God, I don't see any of them killed but that he should
kill one of you. And, if each one of them manages to finish off one of you,
then what use the life thereafter? So, consider!"
This was also the reason why 'Utbah took the stand he took, and the
reason behind the discussion that took place within the Quraysh army.
This was documented by Ibn Ishaq through a weak chain, as in Ibn
Hisham (2/315). As for the fact that the first generation transmitters are
not known, it shouldn't affect the acceptability since they were
Companions.
40 As in Al-Majma' (6/76). kjaythami said: "Its narrators are reliable." Among
those who mentioned the story of the dispute is Tabari in his Tarikh (2/
433) which happens to be Disconnected (Mursal) narratives of Ibn
Musaiyab, and (3/425-426) through a Hasan chain. It is also in Ibn Ishaq
as in Ibn Kathir in Al-Bidayah (3/295-296), in detail via a chain that Dr.
Bawazir declared Sahih in his Marwiyyat Ghazwah Badr, p. 155.

kin leaving bitterness in the heart that will not go away quick.” Abu
Jahl accused him of lack of courage. Angry, 'Utbah came out with
his brother and son flanking him, inviting the Muslims to a dual.
When the Prophet ^ saw him on a red camel he remarked, ”If there
be any good, it is in the rider on that red camel. If they obey him, he
will guide them aright.”41 However, Allah ($s) willed that he should
be disobeyed. His counsel was lost in the storm of Abu Jahl's
arrogance.
The Prophet

had arrived at the Badr waters earlier than the

pagans. He kept the waters behind his men to prevent the pagans
from drawing any. However, Hubab bin Mundhir asked him, "O
Messenger of Allah. Have you chosen this spot following Allah's
revelation which cannot be disagreed with, or is it your choice
following rules of strategy?” When the Prophet

admitted that it

was his own decision, then Hubab said, "Let us rather pitch
ourselves at the end nearest to the enemy line with the water behind
us. There we shall make a cistern and fill it with water leaving
nothing for the enemy.” The Prophet

agreed with him and

shifted to the place Hubab had advised.42

41 From a Hadith of Ahmad in the Musnad, that has been discussed earlier.
42 This suggestion was recorded by Ibn Ishaq with an Interrupted (Munqati')
chain — Ibn Hishdm (2/312-313), and through a chain that disconnected,
stopping at 'Urwah, as pointed out in Al-lsabah (1/302), Al-Hdkim (3/446447), which Dhahabi was not inclined to accept, nor Umawi, as in Ibn
Kathir in Al-Bidayah (3/293) with an Interrupted chain; also in Ibn Shahin
as in Al-Isdbah (1/302), through a defective chain; Ibn Sa'd (2/15) whose
report is in Ibn Kathir in Al-Biddynh (3/293) in which falls Kalbi who stood
rejected. Thus all the chains are weak. But the various narratives strength¬
en each other raising the report to the level of Hasan li Ghayrihi as Bawazir
said in Marwiyydt Ghazwah Badr, pp. 164-165. He has his own arguments
which can be looked into in the original. Yet, one can be skeptic of what
he stated, for the following reasons: There are reports that contradict this
one. Ibn Kathir e.g., quoted Ibn 'Abbas through 'Ali bin Abu Talhah in
explanation of the Verse, "(When) He was causing slumber to overcome you:
as an assurance from Him, and He was sending down water from the heaven to
cleanse you therewith, remove from you satanic defilement, strengthen your
hearts, and steady your feet therewith," that it could be understood as the
polytheists gaining control over water, that the Muslims were terribly

The Battle of Badr

When they had moved to the new place, Sa'd suggested, "O
Messenger of Allah. Why should we not build a hut43 for you? You
can stay there with a camel at your disposal. When the battle begins
and Allah grants us victory over the enemy, then that is what we
covet. However, if it goes wrong then you can take your beast and
race back to our people at Madinah many of whom have not joined
us. They are no less than us in their love of you. Had they known
that you will be meeting with your enemy today, they wouldn't
have remained behind. Once you are with them, they'll protect you
and fight for you." The Prophet I® agreed with the suggestion.44
Nevertheless, what is apparent from the reports is that although
the Prophet ^ occupied the hut, praying and supplicating therein,
he didn't remain within it all the time. In fact, he participated in the
fight that took place. 'Ali has reported in a narration preserved by
Ahmad,45 "I can see ourselves seeking shelter behind the Prophet
on the day of Badr. He was the nearest to the enemy lines. That day

weak, arid that the devil threw fury in their hearts, until Allah the
Almighty sent down rainwater of which they drank and cleansed
themselves (see Tafsir Ibn Kathir 3/563). Ibn Kathir also quoted another
explanation coming through 'Awfi, reaching Ibn 'Abbas, which gives out
similar meaning. Indeed, Ibn Kathir added, "Similar opinions have come
down from Qatadah, Dahhak and Suddi. All these lead us to mistrust the
narrative in question despite its wide acceptance.
“*3 Something similar to a tent or shade which serves as a resting place for
the commander of an army providing him shade.
44 Reported by Ibn Ishaq through an Interrupted (Munqati') chain —Ibn
Hisham (2/313). As regards the construction of a shade for the Prophet sfe
on the day of Badr, it is confirmed by the Sahih Hadith. Umawi reported it
quoting Ibn Ishaq as in Al-Biddyah (3/312) that the Prophet
took a brief
nap and upon waking he said: "O Abu Bakr, rejoice with the glad tiding,
here is Jibril with his headgear on, holding the reins of his horse, leading
it through the ravines. Allah's help and His force has come to you."
Umawi's chain is of Hasap status as noted by Albani in his comment on
Fiqhus-Sirah, p. 243. Its mention is made in a narration of Al-Bukhari/AlFath (18/254/H. 4877) too. In another report of Bazzar that has a reliable
chain, 'Ali said, "We constructed a hut for the Prophet..." This was
mentioned by Ibn Kathir in Al-Biddyah (3/298).
45 Al-Musnad (2/64/Shakir). Shakir said its chain is Sahih.

he was the most fierce against them." The narration says in another
place, "When the going got tough on that day, we sought refuge
behind the Prophet
for he was the strongest of the people. No one
was nearer to the enemy lines than him."46
Muslim47 reports that the Prophet i| told his Companions: "Let
none of you move ahead of me towards the enemy lines." Ibn
Kathir48 said, "He personally fought, and fought hard. And so did
Abu Bakr. The two were also of the most supplicating in the hut
(before the fight). Then they came down, encouraged us to fight
hard and themselves fought hard between the two points (the hut
and the battle lines — Translator).
After the Prophet #! had taken every precautionary measure
possible within human range, he spent the night previous49 to the
fight praying and supplicating to Allah (5s) for help and victory.
Some of his supplicatory words, as preserved by Muslim30 were: "O
Allah. Fulfil Your promise to me. O Allah. Grant me what You had
promised me. O Allah. If this small group is destroyed, you will not
be worshipped thereafter." According to another version, "He kept
beseeching his Lord until his upper garment fell off his shoulder.
Abu Bakr came up from his rear, put back the cloak on his shoulder
and said, "O Prophet of Allah. Your supplications to Allah should
suffice. Surely, He will keep the promise He made you." And Allah
(M) revealed,

“When you were seeking your Lord's help, He responded, 1 shall

47 Muslim (3/1510/H. 1901). The redactor of Jami'ul-Usul says that the
original text says, "Until I give him leave." However, in the printed copies
of Muslim it is, "Until I am by him."

44 Ahmad reported in Al-Musnad (2/271/Shakir) through a Sahih chain
coming from 'Ali who said, "I saw ourselves, there wasn't one of us but
asleep except for the Messenger of Allah. He was praying under a tree
and supplicating until the morning.
50 Muslim (3/1384/H. 1763).

extend you help with a thousand angels coming down one after
another.'"51
And, surely, Allah did help with the angels.
Of the supplicatory words that Bukhari52 has preserved, one
says, "O Allah. I remind You of Your promise. O Allah. If You so
wished. You will not be worshipped after this day." Abu Bakr then
held his hand and said, "It is enough, O Messenger of Allah. You
have beseeched enough." The Prophet
came out of the hut saying,
"The forces will be defeated and they will show their backs." Ibn
Abu Hatim has reported Tkrimah as saying, "When the revelation
came.

'The forces will be defeated and they will show their backs/53
'Umar asked, 'Which force will be defeated and which one will
overcome?'" Later, 'Umar said, "When on the day of Badr the
Prophet
emerged with his coat of arm on him, saying, 'The forces
will be defeated and they will show their backs/ then, that day I
knew its meaning."54
The next day, Friday, seventeenth of Ramadan, second year
after Hijrah,5° when the forces stood against each other, the Prophet

52 See Al-Fath (18/253/H. 4875), and Al-Fath (18/254/H. 4877). Ahmad also
documented it in Musnad (5/18/Shakir) about which Shakir ruled that it
was trustworthy.
53 Surat Al-Qamar: 45.
4 Reported by Ibn Kathir in his Tafsir (7/457) as a disconnected narrative of
Tkrimah. Sa'ati said when reporting this Ftadith in Al-Fathur-Rabbdni (21/
390) "The Hadith is authentic which Ibn Kathir quoted in his Tafsir and
ascribed it to Bukhari through 'Affan, and he through Wuhayb." Then he
added, "Bukhari and Nasa'i have recounted it in several places tracing it
through Khalid who has been identified as Ibn Mihran."
55 Ibn Hajar said in At-Talkhisul-Habir: "As regards the battle of Badr, there
has been consensus among the biographers that it took place in the second
year after Hijrah: Ibn Ishaq, Musa bin 'Uqbah, Abul-Aswad and others.
They also agreed that it took place in Ramadan. Ibn 'Asakir said that it

gg supplicated, "O Allah. This is Quraysh. They have come with
their pride and arrogance, crying lies to Your Messenger. O Allah.
Send the help You promised me. O Allah, destroy them by the
noon.”56
When the Muslims arranged themselves in rows, the Prophet #|
began to straighten the rows with the help of an arrow. Accidentally
he pricked therewith Sawad bin Ghaziyyah in his stomach, trying to
push him behind saying, "Sawad. Fall in line.” Sawad replied, "O
Messenger of Allah. You have hurt me. Allow me retribution.” The
Prophet #1 raised his shirt to bare his stomach and said, ”Go ahead
with the retribution.” Sawad bent down and kissed it. He asked,
"What made you do that Sawad?” He replied, "O Messenger of
Allah. You can see what we are faced up with. I thought, 'Let my
final act be that my skin touch yours.'” The Prophet ^ supplicated
for him.57

was generally thought that it took place on a Friday although some
thought it was a Monday. But that was a stray opinion. The majority also
believe that it took place on the seventeenth. Some said it was on the
twelfth of Ramadan that they started and seventeenth the day of battle.
Tabari recorded in his Tdrikh (2/419) via a Hasan chain on the authority of
Ibn Mas'ud 4e, who said in connection with The Night of Power: “Look
for it on the seventeenth, 'Wlten the two forces met.'" See also Bawazir: (pp.
68-73).
56 Reported by Ibn Ishaq, with a Suspended (Mu'allay) chain, as also Ibn
Hishdm (2/314). It is confirmed that Abu Jahl said when the two forces
met: “O Allah, destroy this morning the one of us who severed the blood
ties and who introduced among us what we know not." Thus he was the
one who sought judgment, and through this supplication, brought the
judgment upon himself. Allah, the Almighty, revealed in this connection:
"If you are seeking a judgment, then, now the judgment has come to you. If you
desist, it will be better for you. If you resume (your war against the faithful), We
will return (to their help), and your forces, superior though they be in number,
shall avail you nothing, for Allah is with the faithful," Surat Al-Anfal: 19. This
Hddith was reported through reliable chains by Ahmad: Al-Fathur-Rabbdni
(21/44); Tabari in his Tafsir (13/454/Shakir) through a reliable chain;
Hakim (2/328) who declared it authentic. As for the supplication and the
words, “He was the one who sought judgment," were reported by Ibn
Ishaq — Ibn Hishdm (2/323) through a Disconnected (Mursal) chain.
57 Sawad's incidence was reported by Ibn Ishaq through an Interrupted

Thereafter he gave directions to them concerning the battle
about to begin. He said, "When they come nearer, start with the
arrows but use them sparingly.58 And don't charge them with
your swords until they are pretty close." He also encouraged them
to fight hard saying, "By Him in Whose Hand is my life, no one
will fight hard today, patiently, hoping to be rewarded, without
showing his back, but Allah will admit him into Paradise."59
According to a report-in Muslim60 when the enemy got close, he
said, "Reach out for a Paradise whose breadth is the heavens and
the earth." When 'Umayr bin Humam Ansari heard it, he said, "O
Messenger of Allah! A Paradise whose breadth is the heavens and
the earth?" He replied, "Yes." He said, "Bakh, bakh."61 The
Prophet
asked, "What made you say that?" He replied,
"Nothing except that I hope to be one of its dwellers." He said,
"You are one of its dwellers." 'Umayr took out a few dates and
began to eat. Then he said, "If I live until I finish these dates, that
would be a long life." So he threw away the dates and fought until
he was killed.62

'Awf bin Harith bin ' Afra' asked, "O Messenger of Allah. What
deed of the slave makes the Lord laugh?” The Prophet ^ replied,
"A man's deep incursion into the enemy lines.” 'Awf removed his
coat of mail, threw it away and fought until he was killed.
Before the fighting began the Prophet
instructed his
Companions that they were not to kill anyone of the Banu
Hashim for they had been forced into the conflict. Some of those
he named were Abu Bakhtari bin Hisham-he was one of those
who had got the boycott lifted and had never misbehaved with the
Prophet j|§ — and 'Abbas bin 'Abdul-Muttalib. When Abu
Hudhayfah heard the instruction he remarked, "Shall we kill our
fathers, sons, brothers and other kin and spare 'Abbas? By Allah, if
I encounter him I'll kill him.” His words reached the Prophet
He complained to 'Umar, Hafsah's father, "Will the Prophet's
uncle's face be struck with a sword?” 'Umar said, "Allow me O
Messenger of Allah that I behead this man. I think he is a
hypocrite." Abu Hudhayfah used to say, "I never felt myself in
peace with 'Umar thereafter because of what I said that day. And I
still fear my words unless they can be atoned with martyrdom.”
He was martyred in the Yamamah battle.53
Before the battle would begin, Aswad bin 'Abdul-Asad the
Makhzumi came out saying, "I swear by God that I shall drink
from the water of the wells in their custody, destroy it, or die."
Hamzah confronted him and struck him with a sword that
severed off both his shanks. He began to crawl — bleeding
heavily —to reach the waters so as to fulfil his oath. Hamzah
followed him and beheaded him while he had sunk his face in
i

the water.

63 Reported by Ibn Ishaq with an Interrupted (Munqati") chain — Ibn Hisham
(2/324). Bawazir, p. 268, believes that sometimes Ibn Ishaq reported this
through an authentic chain in connection with the battle of Badr; and this
is what we also believe. A report says that Abu Bakhtari insisted on
fighting and hence was killed.
64 His story was reported by Ibn Ishaq without a chain—Ibn Hisham (2/318).
Probably it is part of his Badr narrations that have come through a Good
(Hasan) chain.

Duel Fights

After that three horsemen came out seeking duel fights. They
were 'Utbah bin Rabi'ah and his two brothers Shaybah and Walid.
Three of the Ansar accepted the challenge: Harith's sons 'Awf and
Mu awwidh and Abdullah bin Rawahah. The Qurayshites refused
to fight them and demanded that the Muhajir should respond. So the
Prophet m, sent out 'Ubaydah bin Harith, Hamzah and 'Ali. Hamzah
met 'Utbah, 'Ubaydah met Walid and 'Ali met Shaybah. 'Ali and
Hamzah slew their opponents. Then they turned to 'Ubaydah to
finish off Walid and carried him off injured by Walid's strike.65
Allah (®?) revealed about these six men,

"These were two disputants that disputed about their Lord. So,

Then the Prophet ^ asked 'Ali to hand him over a handful of dust
and pebbles. He threw them in the face of the enemy and not one was

65 This is the content of the report of Abu Dawud in his Sunan (4/49/H. 2665).
Ibn Hajar said, "This is the most accurate of narratives." Then he added,
"However, the biographies generally state that the one who fought the duel
with 'Ali was Walid, and that seems to be correct because 'Ubaydah and
Shaybah were both matured men, as were 'Utbah and Hamzah. In contrast,
'Ali and Walid were youths. Tabarani reported through a Hasan chain that
'Ali said: 'Hamzah and I helped 'Ubaydah bin Harith against Walid bin
'Utbah and the Prophet
showed no signs of disapproval.' This agrees
with the narrative of Abu Dawud; Allah knows best." See Al-Fath (15/163)
without a chain—Ibn Hisham (2/319) and Ibn Sa'd (2/17-23). See the others
in Al-Fath (15/152). Of the Hadith recorders, it was preserved by Ahmad: AlFathur-Rabbdni (21/31-32). Haythami said in Al-Majma' (6/76): "Ahmad's
chain consists of men of SaHih narratives, except for Harithah bin Mudarrib,
who in any case was trustworthy." Also reported by Bazzar in his Musnad,

"When your Lord revealed to the angels, 'I am with you. So,
steady the believers. I will soon cast terror in the hearts of the
disbelievers, so, smite them above the necks, and strike them over
every joint (of the body)."72
A few Ahddith (traditions) have also been reported on this issue.
One in Muslim says/3 "That day, while a Muslim was chasing a
pagan trying to escape, he heard from above the sound of a rider's
whip and someone saying, 'Onward, O Hayzum.'74 The next thing
he saw was that the pagan was fallen on the ground, nose flattened,
and face with a deep blue whip mark. The Ansari reported the
matter to the Prophet $g|. He remarked, "You spoke the truth. That
was the help from the third heaven."
Ahmad72 has reported that a short man from the Ansar brought
'Abbas as a prisoner. 'Abbas said, "O Messenger of Allah. It is not
this man who captured me. The one who captured me was a man of
an extremely beautiful countenance, on a striped horse that I don't
see him around now." But the Ansari insisted that he had captured
him. The Prophet
told him, "Be quiet man. Allah (*5c) helped with
a noble angel."
Umawi7b has reported that the Prophet #§ dozed off for a few
moments in the hut built for him. As he came on again he said,
"Abu Bakr. Good news. Allah's help has come. Here is Jibril with
72 Surat Al-Anfal: 12.
73 Sahih Muslim (3/1384-1385/H. 1763).
74 Hayzum was the name of the angel's horse, as Nawawi said when
explaining it in Sahih Muslim (12/86). An-Nihdyah fi Gharibil-Hadith has it
that it is the name of Jibril's horse.
75 Al-Musnad (2/194/Shakir) from a long Hadith. Shakir said, "Its chain is
Sahih.” It is also there in Majmauz-Zawa'id (6/75-76) where he said,
"Ahmad and Bazzar preserved it. Ahmad's narrators are those of Sahih
except for Harithah bin Mudarrib who too was trustworthy." Albani
however declared it Hasan while commenting on Fiqhus-Sirah by Ghazali,
p. 243. And the name of Jthe person who took 'Abbas as prisoner was
Abul-Yasar bin 'Amr who has been identified as Ka'b bin 'Amr (Musnad
5/105/Shakir). The chain however is weak.
76 Ibn Kathir quoted it in Al-Bidayah (3/312) which is a narration from Ibn
Ishaq through a Hasan chain as said Albani when commenting on FiqhusSirah by Ghazali, p. 243. See it in Ibn Hishdm (2/321-322) with an

the turban on, leading his horse. His horse has dust on its teeth. The
help Allah (fg) had promised has arrived.”
Several Ahadith speak of the arrival of the angels in the battle of
Badr but none of them are specific about them taking part in the
fighting. Bukhari has a report that the Prophet #| said on that day,
"This is Jibril fully armed leading his horse.” According to another
report he said, "Once Jibril came to the Prophet
and asked, 'What
do you think of those who participated in (the battle of) Badr?' The
Prophet s|| replied, 'We think of them as the best of Muslims.' Jibril
said, 'We too consider those angels the best of us who participated
in the battle of Badr.'”77
Hakim78 has reported that Zubayr had a yellow turban on his
head and so the angels also came with yellow headgears.
Allah ($g) also blessed the Muslims on that day with a few
miracles. It is reported that 'Ukkashah bin Mihsan fought with his
sword until it broke in his hand. The Prophet ^ gave him a wooden
shank to fight with. It turned into a sword of white shining steel in
his hand. He fought on therewith the rest of the battle as well as in
several battles thereafter. The last he used it was in the battle of
Yamamah when he was martyred.'9
When Iblis (Satan), who had joined the pagan ranks in the form
of Suraqah bin Malik in his effort to coax them into the battle,
witnessed what the angels and the Muslims were doing to the
pagans, he disowned them and turning backward ran until he
reached the sea 80
Interrupted (Munqati') chain. Umawi however presented a complete chain.
As did Bayhaqi in Dald'il (7/54) tracing it through two chains different
from that of Ibn Ishaq.

78 Al-Mustadrak (3/361). Bawazir declared its chain authentic in Marwiyyat
Ghazwah Badr, p. 243.
79 Reported by Ibn Ishaq without a chain—Ibn Hisham (2/336); Waqidi in
Maghdzi (1/93); Bayhaqi in Ad-Dalail (2/98-99) who takes it from Waqidi,
and Ibn Sa'd (1/188) who has a chain other than that of Ibn Ishaq.
Nevertheless, the chain is very weak for two reasons: One, being
Disconnected (Mursal) and second weakness in Abu Ma'shar who was
identified as Najih bin 'Abdur-Rahman.

The falling Places of the Pagan Leaders

1. Abu Jahl:
Bukhari*1 and Muslim82 have reported through 'Abdur-Rahman bin 'Awf
that he said, "I was in one of the rows on the day of

(5/41/H. 4550) from 'whom Haythami requited in Al-Majma' (6/77)
commenting: "It has 'Abdul-'Aziz bin 'Imran, who was weak." Also
documented by Tabari in his‘Tarikh (2/431), via a Disconnected (Mursal)
chain, and so just acceptable, as also Waqidi (1/71). Ahmad too has it (14/7/
H. 16183/Shakir). Shakir said about Ahmad's chain that it is weak because of
the break in the chain between 'Ali bin Abu Talhah and Ibn 'Abbas.
Muhammad Husayn Dhahabi has mentioned in his Tafsir wal-Mufassirun
(1/77) discussing the report of Ibn 'Abbas: "First, through Mu'awiyah bin
Salih —'Ali bin Abu Talhah —Ibn 'Abbas. This is one of the best chains
about which Imam Ahmad said, 'In Egypt lies a book in Tafsir that 'Ali
bin Abu Talhah narrated. If someone were to travel to Egypt for this work
alone, he wouldn't be doing much.' Ibn Hajar said, "This manuscript
remained with Abu Salih, Layth's secretary. He reported through
Mu'awiyah bin Salih —'Ali bin Abu Talhah —Ibn 'Abbas. Bukhari has it
through Abu Salih. He accepted such reports that reach Ibn 'Abbas
through Abu Salih.' This then is the route that Shakir declared weak. In
any case, Ibn Jarir brought it in his Tafsir (14/7/16183/Shakir). He traced
it through Mu'awiyah bin Salih—'Ali bin Abu Talhah-Ibn 'Abbas.
Subsequently he mentioned the same story through another route of
Qatadah (3/9/16187) and Ibn 'Abbas (3/9/16188) through an Interrupted
(.Munqati') chain for Ibn Jurayj never met Ibn 'Abbas; as also through
Hasan Basri (3/10/16191). The story is also in Bayhaqi in Dalail (3/111,
115) being a narrative of Musa bin 'Uqbah. As for this latter's reports are
considered the most»trustworthy by the chroniclers. Whenever Imam
Malik was asked about war reports he would say, "Look into the pious
man Musa bin 'Uqbah's narratives, for it is the basis of all war
chronicles." See Dala'il (3/101). His war chronicles were reported by
Isma'il bin Ibrahim bin 'Uqbah (d. 158). Musa bin 'Uqbah had met
'Abdullah bin 'Umar while traveling to Makkah for Hajj. He also sat in
the circles of Zuhri, living in Madinah. See Dala'il (3/101, f.n. 1).
Thus the story is true as it comes through Mu'awiyah bin Salih—'Ali bin
Abu Talhah —'Ibn 'Abbas. Other reports gain weight from this one.

words here.

the battle. As I looked around I found two lads on my left and right.
I didn't feel very pleased with such young ones by my sides. One of
them asked me in secret, as if not wishing the other one to hear,
'Uncle. Can you identify Abu Jahl for me.' I asked him, 'My dear
nephew. What have you to do with him?' He said, 'I have heard that
he used to insult the Prophet #|. By Allah, if I see him today, I shall
not leave him until one of us is dead.' The boy's words amazed me.
Then the other one took me into confidence and asked me the same
question. I saw Abu Jahl moving about among the people. I said,
'Do you two see that man. That's the one you are looking for.' They
rushed forward, attacked him and killed him. Then they went up to
the Prophet i|§. He asked, 'Which of you killed him?' Both claimed
to have killed him. He asked them, 'Have you wiped your swords?'
They said, 'No.' He looked at their swords and said, 'Both of you
killed him.' The Prophet |j§ ordered Abu Jahl's belongings to be
given to Mu'adh bin ' Amr bin Jamuh,S3 the other being Mu'adh bin
'Afra', who later got killed in the same battle."
Ibn Ishaq84 reports from Mu'adh bin Jamuh who said, "I
heard from the people that Abu Jahl was well protected, being
always surrounded by his pagan pals.85 The general opinion was
that no one could get at him. When I heard that, I decided to
target him. When I got my opportunity, I attacked him hitting him
hard on the leg to shear it from the shank. His son 'Ikrimah came
on me and struck me with his sword on my shoulder. That blow
sheared off my arm altogether which hung by its skin. I threw the
hand behind my back and kept fighting with it dangling at the
back. When it became very painful to carry it, I put it under a foot
and tore it off. Then Mu'awwidh bin 'Afra' happened to pass by
Abu Jahl. He was unconscious. He finished him off and fought on
until he was killed.

had died down, "Let someone find out what happened to Abu
Jahl. Ibn Mas'ud
went into the field looking for him. He learnt
that he had been brought down by the two sons of 'Afra'. He pulled
him by his beard and asked him, "Are you Abu Jahl?" Abu Jahl
replied, "(Another insult) upon the fact that you killed the man?" or,
he said, "a man killed by his people."
Ahmad's87 report tells us that the Prophet <g| himself went
down to see his body and as he saw him lying on the ground,
remarked, "This was the Fir'awn of this Ummah."
Ibn Ishaq88 adds that when Ibn Mas'ud went up to Abu Jahl
and tried to behead him by placing his foot on his head, he
remarked, "You have climbed high, O shepherd."

2. Umaiyah bin Khalaf:

'Abdur-Rahman bin 'Awf
was able to capture Umaiyah bin
Khalaf. However, when Bilal 4® saw him he cried out in anguish,
"Here is the fountain-head of disbelief Umaiyah bin Khalaf. I will
not feel secure if this man is alive." 'Abdur-Rahman tried to pacify
Bilal but he wouldn't listen. Instead, he shouted for help from the
Ansar. They rushed forward and despite Ibn 'Awf's protests and his
efforts to save Umaiyah by covering him while the man crouched on
the ground, they managed to kill him.89
When the pagan corpses were being thrown into the pit,
Umaiyah's corpse could not be thrown. His body swelled and his
coat of arm couldn't be relieved off him. When they tried to drag it,
it split into pieces. So they left it where it was and threw stones on it
to cover it.90

'As bin Hisham was 'Umar bin Khattab's uncle. 'Umar sought
to kill him and, finally, did manage to do so. That he did to

The battle of Badr resulted in a big victory for the Muslims.
They killed off seventy of the pagans and captured another
seventy.92 Of the Muslims fourteen were killed: six from the
Quraysh and eight from the Ansar 93
The pagans fully deserved the retribution for the past deeds.

Qurayshi chieftains100 to be thrown into one of the deserted wells. It
was his practice to stay put three days in a place he had met with
victory. When it was the third day at Badr, he ordered his beast to
be got ready. He started off on it. Some of the Companions began to
follow him saying, "He must be on an errand." The Prophet
stopped at the pit. He stood at its edge and began to call them by
their and their fathers names, saying, "O so-and-so, O so-and-so, do
you now realize that you should have obeyed Allah and His
Messenger? We have found Allah's promises made to us true. Do
you also find that the promise your Lord made to you have come
true?" 'Umar remonstrated, "O Messenger of Allah. Are you talking
to lifeless corpses?" He replied, "By Him in Whose Hand is
Muhammad's life, you hear no better than they do now."
In reference to the Verse (Ar-Rum: 52): "... For, you cannot make
the dead hear, nor make the deaf hear the call when they are turning
away," Ibn Kathir has said in his commentary that 'Aishah's opinion
was that 'Abdullah bin 'Umar was mistaken to say that the Prophet
Wb spoke to the dead in the pit after three days had passed over
them. The reports to this effect are in Muslim, Ahmad and Nasa'i.
However, 'Aishah interpreted the Prophet's words as meaning that
'now they realize that what I had been warning them about was
true.' But Qatadah's opinion was that Allah ($g) brought them to life
so that they could hear the Prophet's words and chiding.
Nonetheless, the opinion of the scholars is that Ibn 'Umar's
report is authentic for the reasons that there are so many parallel
reports confirming it.
When the pagan corpses were being thrown into the pit and
'Utbah bin Rabi'ah's turn came, the Prophet il| looked at the face of
his son Abu Hudhayfah. He turned pale. The Prophet #§ asked,
"Perhaps you feel for your father." He replied, "By Allah, that is not
the case O Messenger of Allah. I have no feelings for my father nor
for his being killed. Rather, I knew my father all along as a wise.

The total number of polytheists killed at Badr was seventy as mentioned
earlier. It appears the others were buried in another place as stated by Ibn
Hajar in Al-Fath.

patient, reasonable man. I was hopeful that he would be guided to
Islam. When I saw what happened to him, and remembered that he
died on disbelief, I really felt sorry for him." The Prophet
supplicated for Abu Hudhayfah in good words.101
After the battle was over and the prisoners had been captured,
someone suggested that they now go after the trade caravan which
had no one to protect. But 'Abbas 4b said, "That won't be right." He
was asked, "Why?" He replied, "Because you had been promised
one of the two parties and Allah has already given you one of
them."102
Badr battle took place on a Friday, the seventeenth of Ramadan
of the second year after Hijrah. This is reported by Ibn Ishaq tracing
it through Abu Ja'far, as well as Ibn Sa'd who traced it through other
transmitters.

War Spoils
Since the injunctions regarding war spoils had not been
revealed until then, differences arose over their distribution.
'Ubadah bin Samit reports, "We went out with the Prophet m
and I was one of those present at Badr. The two forces met there and
Allah defeated the enemy. Among the Muslims, a group began to
chase them and cut them down. Another group began to collect the
booty. A third group remained with the Prophet
guarding him so
that he was not taken unawares by the enemy. At night when they
all got together, those who had collected the booty laid their
exclusive claim to it. Those who had given the enemy the chase
asserted on the other hand that they were no less deserving, since it
was they who had annihilated the enemy. Those who had stayed
behind guarding the Prophet said that they deserved no less because

chain authentic. Ibn Kathir said in his Tafsir (4/13-14): "Its attribution is
good." Tirmidhi however thought it was Hasan (4/112), being a report
coming through 'Abdur-Razzaq and he through Israel.

"They ask you concerning the booty. Say unto them, 1The booty

Thereafter, the Prophet ^ divided the booty among the
participants equally."104
What can be deduced from various reports105 that have come
down is that a fifth was kept aside, and the rest was distributed
among the fighters. 'Ali
reports that one-fifth was left at the
disposal of the Prophet
following Allah's commandment.
The Prophet
also gave a share to each of the nine men he had
either engaged in some services, or who had a good reason for

103 Surat An-Anfal: 1. See its explanation in At-Tabari (13/367-371/Shakir). It is
stated therein that the report has come through reliable sources. Ibn Ishaq
mentioned through a Hasan chain—Ibn Hisham (2/344) that this Ayah was
revealed, according to 'Ubadah bin Samit
in connection with the
participants of Badr when they differed between themselves over the
spoils of war. Hakim treated it as authentic, as did Dhahabi as found in
Al-Mustadrak and Talkhis. The Hadith was also documented by Ahmad in
Al-Musnad, Al-Fathur-Rabbdni (14/72) with the same chain as that of Ibn
Ishaq about which Sa'ati said that the chain was good enough.
Sa'd bin Mu'adh 4® has mentioned the race for the spoils between
Muslims as reported by Ibn Ishaq.
104 Reported by Ahmad in the Musnad which Sa'ati thought was through a
reliable chain as in Al-Fathur-Rabbdni (14/73). He also quoted Tirmidhi,
Hakim, Dhahabi as trusting it. As regards its distribution equally between
them, this was mentioned by Ibn Ishaq through a Good (Hasan) chain—
Ibn Hisham (2/344). It was also preserved by Ibn Hibban in his Sahih as
mentioned in Al-Mawarict, p. 410, as well as Hakim in his Al-Mustadrak (2/
135-136) where he said, "This is a reliable report meeting the conditions of
Muslim although the two did not record it." Dhahabi however was silent
over the remark. Bayhaqi also recorded in Sunan (6/292).

failing to participate. One of those who was given a share was
'Uthman bin 'Affan *&>. He couldn't participate because he was
attending his wife and the Prophet's daughter Ruqayyah ^ who
was sick.106
War spoils were distributed in the Safra' region during the
return journey. As for the prisoners, they were taken to Madinah.107
Zayd bin Harithah and 'Abdullah bin Rawahah were sent to
Madinah in advance. The Madinans received the news with joy
mixed with incredulity. Usamah bin Zayd said, “By Allah. I didn't
believe it until I saw the prisoners with my eyes."108 Sawdah
was
so amazed when she saw Suhayl bin' Amr with has hands tied to his
neck that she taunted him, “O Abu Yazid. Did you just give yourself
up? Couldn't you fight to death?" The Prophet
interjected, “Are
you inciting people against Allah and His Messenger?" She replied,
"O Messenger of Allah, when I saw Abu Yazid in that condition, his
hands tied to his neck, I couldn't hold my peace."109

IIW Reported by Ibn Ishaq - Ibn Hisham (2/348-349) via a Mursal chain. Hakim
however, recorded the entire chain in Al-Mustadrak (3/22) remarking,
"Authentic by Muslim's standards although the two did not record it."
Dhahabi agreed with him. Suhayl bin 'Amr is, by the way, a brother of
Sakran bin 'Amr, Sawdah's husband before the Prophet ig married her.
He died in Makkah after his return from the emigration to Abyssinia.

strengthen the Muslims and weaken the disbelievers. Also, Allah
(M) might guide them to Islam. However, 'Umar thought
that
they should all be killed. For they were chiefs of the pagans. The
Prophet
himself was inclined towards Abu Bakr's opinion. But
the Qur'an came down agreeing with 'Umar's opinion. It said.

"And it is not for any Prophet that he should have captives before
he has inflicted a massacre in the land. You desire the chance
goods of the world, but Allah desires the Hereafter. And Allah is
All-Mighty, All-Wise. If not for a writing of Allah preceding,
surely, a terrible chastisement would have touched you for what
you took.”110
The revelation ended with.

"Partake now (freely), of what you have secured of the spoils:
lawful, goodly. And fear Allah. Verily, Allah is All-Forgiving,
All-Kind."* * 111
In early Islam acceptance of ransom was allowed. Thereafter, it
was left to the choice of the leader of the Muslims. Either he killed,
accepted ransom or set the prisoners free at no cost. And, of course,
women and children were not to be killed in any case — so long as
they did not participate in the fighting.112 Allah (it) said.

The Prophet of Islam

"So, when you meet those who disbelieve, strike at (their) necks
until when you have inflicted heavy slaughter on them, secure
their bonds, and either (confer) favor thereafter, or (accept)
ransom until the war lays down its burden.''113
The amount of ransom varied. For those who could afford it
was 4000 dirhams.114 Of those who paid this sum, Abu Wada'ah
was one. 'Abbas paid 100 ounces of silver.' 'Aqil bin Abu Talib had
to pay 80 ounces, which 'Abbas did on his behalf. However, others
paid only 40 ounces each.115
The Prophet #| granted freedom at no cost to 'Amr bin Abu
Sufyan in return for Sa'd bin Nu'man bin Ukkal whom Abu Sufyan
had captured while he was performing ‘Umrah.116
Those who could not pay the ransom amount but knew how to
read and write were asked to teach the Ansar children the art.
Ahmad117 has reported through Ibn 'Abbas
who said, ''There
were some prisoners at Badr who were not asked to pay any
11J Surat Muhammad: 4.
il4Haythami: Al-Majma' (6/90) with a remark that Tabarani documented it
through trustworthy transmitters in connection with the story of Abu
Wada'ah whose son paid a ransom of four thousand dirhams to free him.
Ibn Hisham said in his additional notes to the Sirat (2/371) without a chain
that the ransom for release of a polytheist varied from one thousand to
four thousand dirhams, except when someone had nothing to pay. Such of
them the Prophet
released without ransom. This was recorded by
'Abdur-Razzaq in his Al-Musannaf (5/206) and Abu Dawud in his Sunan
(3/139-140/H. 6291) with a slight difference. The chain has Abu Qanbas
who was Acceptable (Maqbul), as in At-Taqrib (p. 662). It is also in
Tabarani in his Al-Kabir (11/406-407) and Al-Awsat through reliable
transmitters. It is supported by "...Tire ransom amount for each of the
prisoners was four thousand." Thus the narrative acquires the Good
(Hasan) status as noted by the two redactors of Ibn Hisham (2/371).
11 Reported by Abu Nu'aym in his Dald'il (2/476-477) through a Hasan chain
as remarked by Ibn Hajar in Al-Fath (15/192).
116 Reported by Ibn Ishaq through an Interrupted (Munqati') chain-Ibn
Hisham (2/357-358).
117 Al-Musnad (4/47/H. 2216/Shakir). Shakir said its chain is Sahih. The chain

reliable but quite often committed errors. Shakir however thought he was

ransom. Instead, the Prophet #§ ordered that they teach the Ansar
children how to read and write. One of the children went back home
crying. His father asked him the reason and the child said his master
had beaten him. The father said, 'The rascal is filled with hatred on
account of Badr. By God, don't go to him any more.'"
Some prisoners were allowed to pay the sum they could afford.
For instance, Zaynab, the Prophet's daughter, who was still in
Makkah, sent her necklace as ransom for her husband Abul-'As bin
Rabi'. The necklace was returned and the man was set free because
of his relationship with the-Prophet sH.118 A few others who could
not afford to pay anything, were also released by the Prophet
some way or the other. Muttalib bin Hantab Makhzumi, Sayfi bin
Abu Rifa'ah and Abu 'Izzah the poet119 were some of those who
were released without payment of any ransom.
There was every possibility that all of them would have gained
freedom without having to pay anything. The Prophet s|§ said,
"Had Mut'im bin 'Adi been alive today and spoken to me about
these prisoners, I would have released them all for his sake."120 This
was in return of the protection that he had provided the Prophet
during his visit to Ta'if as as well as for his role in tearing down the
boycott document.
When one of the Ansar suggested that they release 'Abbas for
nothing, the Prophet
remarked, "By Allah. Don't concede a
dirham."121 This was despite the fact that 'Abbas was at heart a
Muslim and that he had been forced to join the pagans at Badr.122

The Prophet of Islam
However, a few of the prisoners were killed on the way back to

Madinah. One of them was Nadr bin Harith. He was executed by
'Ali at Safra'. 'Uqbah bin Abu Mu'ayt was killed at 'Irquz-Zubyah.
'Asim bin Thabit12^ executed him. Some say 'Ali124 executed him.
The third to be killed was Tu'aymah bin 'Adi. These three were
killed because of their extreme enmity to the Prophet

'Uqbah,

although originally a Jew,125 had attached himself to the Quraysh.
He was a haughty proud man. The turn of events had humbled him.
He asked the Prophet s||, seeking mercy, "Who will take care of
(my) children?" The Prophet

answered, "Fire."126

And Tabarani has reported through a trustworthy chain of
narrators through Ibn 'Abbas, and from whom Shami quoted in his

Subul, that the Prophet i§ got Tu'aymah bin 'Adi killed while held
as a prisoner.
As for the rest of the prisoners, they were treated well12' on the
Prophet's order. Abu 'Aziz, Mus'ab bin 'Umayr's brother reports

people forced me (into this battle)/" Al-Fath (15/192). Ibn Ishaq also confirms
the Islam of 'Abbas — Ibn Hishdm (2/351-352) via a Connected (Muttasil) chain
insisting on having himself heard it, nevertheless, the chain has Husayn bin
'Abdullah whose dependability has been questioned.
'23 Ibn Ishaq without a chain — Ibn Hishdm (2/347).
124 Ibn Hishdm (2/347) through an Interrupted (Munqati') chain. It is stated
that the Verse: "And (remember) the Day when the wrongdoer will bite at his
hands and say, 'Oh! Would that 1 had taken a path with the Messenger. Woe
unto me! Would that I had never taken so-and-so as a friend," (Al-Furqdn:27),
was revealed in reference to him. Ibn Jarir reported Ibn 'Abbas that Ubaiy
bin Khalaf used to visit the Prophet #?. Once when 'Uqbah bin Abu
Mu'ayt chided him this Verse was revealed: "When the wrongdoer will bite
at his hand..." till "... Fie indeed led me astray from the Reminder." He said the
wrongdoer was 'Uqbah, and "so-and-so" was Ubaiy bin Khalaf. See Ibn
Kathir: The Tafsir (6/116), footnote 5. Ibn Kathir said at that point,
"Whether it was revealed in connection with 'Uqbah bin Abu Mu'ayt or
not, its application is general."
See Suhayli: Ar-Rawdul-Unuf (3/53) where he mentioned that he was
originally Jewish of the Saffuriyya.
1Haythami said in Al-Majma' (6/89): "Tabarani recorded in his Al-Kabir as
well as Al-Awsat whose transmitters are those of the Sahih (works). See AlKabir (11/406-407/H. 12154).
17This was documented by Tabarani in his books: Al-Mu'jam As-Saghir and

423

that while he was a prisoner among the Ansar, they used to offer
him bread at lunch and dinner while they themselves ate dates
following the Prophet's instruction that they be treated well.
Sometimes, if a piece of bread reached the hands of one of his
custodians, they would return it to him. He would feel ashamed and
return it but they wouldn't touch it,128 letting him eat it.
No surprise then that many of the prisoners turned Muslim
during the coming years, both before and after the Makkan victory.
'Abbas, 'Aqil bin Abu Talib, Nawfal bin Harith bin 'Abdul-Muttalib,
Khalid bin Hisham, 'Abdullah bin Sa'ib, Muttalib bin Hantab bin
Harith, Abu Wada'ah Harith bin Subayrah, Hajjaj bin Harith bin
Qays, 'Abdullah bin Abu Ibn Khalaf, Wahb bin 'Umayr, Suhayl bin
'Amr, 'Abd bin Zam'ah, Qays bin Sa'ib, Nistas the freed slave of
Umaiyah bin Khalaf and others were those of the prisoners who
embraced Islam.

Badr was an important event in the annals of Islamic history.
The Qur'an called it the day of Furqan — the day when truth and
falsehood came to be distinguished. The Ahadith speak of high ranks
in Paradise for those who participated in this battle. Bukhari has a
whole chapter on the superiority of those who participated in it. One
of the reports is about Harithah bin Suraqah who was struck by an
arrow in that battle. He was then just a boy. His mother came asking
the Prophet 0 where her son would be on the Day of Judgement.
The Prophet 0 gave her the news that he was amidst gardens in

Fir daws Paradise.130
We also have the story of Hatib bin Abu Balta'ah who wrote to
the Quraysh just before the Makkan expedition informing them of
the Prophet's intention. Revelation informed the Prophet 0 of his
action. But he forgave him and told 'Umar bin Khattab, when he

Al-Mu'jam Al-Kabir as Haythami in his book Al-Majma' (6/86). Haythami
said: "Its chain is Hasan."

Hisham (2/349-350).

in Al-Isabah, Al-Isti'ab and Usdul-Ghabah and other biography works.

The Prophet of Islam

demanded that he be killed, “Allah looked upon those who
participated at Badr and said, 'Do as you wish. Paradise is yours,
or, He said, 'for, I have forgiven you.'"
When one of the slaves owned by Hatib said, “O Messenger
of Allah. Hatib will enter into the Fire." He replied, “You have
lied. He will never enter into it for he participated in the battles
of Badr and Hudaybiyah."131
Obviously, the results at Badr had a deep effect on the Madinan
population as well as those around. The believers now felt greater
confidence in dealing with the Jews and pagans. The Jews felt
mortified and began to evince greater enmity towards Islam. It
finally led to the deportation of the Banu Qaynuqa' from Madinah.
As for those who were clean-hearted, the results opened their
eyes and they embraced Islam. Some, however, decided to wear the
veil of hypocrisy, for reasons of their own. They were led by
'Abdullah bin Ubaiy bin Salul who remarked, “This is something
that has happened.132 We can't change the course of events now."133
Some of those Jews whose hypocrisy came to be exposed were:
Zayd bin Lasit, Rafi' bin Huraymilah, Rifa'ah bin Zayd bin Tabut,
Suwayd bin Harith, Sa'd bin Hunayf, Nu'man bin Awfa bin 'Amr,
his brother 'Uthman bin Awfa, Silsilah bin Yarham and Kinanah bin
Suriya.
And some of those Madinans whose hypocrisy got exposed
were: Zuwaiy bin Harith, Julas bin Suwayd, his brother Harith bin
Suwayd, Nabtal bin Harith, Mirba' bin Qayzi, his brother Aws bin
Qayzi, Hatib bin Umaiyah bin Rafi', Bushayr bin Ubayriq Abu
Tu'mah and Quzman.
131 It is in Muslim too — An-Nawawi (16/55). In his dealing with the story of
Tha'labah and Iris procrastination to pay Zakdt, Bawazir spent some four
pages to conclude that the one alluded to in the story was Tha'labah bin
Abu Hatib and not Tha'labah bin Hatib, the one who participated at Badr.
In addition, the chain of transmission of this story is weak and altogether
unworthy of attention.

Of the above, some of the Jews and Madinans subsequently
became true Muslims but others died on hypocrisy. We shall later
mention those who became true Muslims in a few years.134

Lessons
The event of Badr brought many lessons and some new rules. A
few important ones are:
1.

It is allowable to harass the enemy by attacking and killing its
men, confiscating their property, and threatening them with the
closure of the routes in order to weaken them materially and
morally.

2.

It is allowed to use spies to gather news on enemy lines.

3.

The Prophet's example of consulting those of the community
who were capable of giving right advice was brought to fore.
This is something proven by Quranic texts as well as by the
example left to us by the four rightly-guided caliphs. Qur anic
injunction is in the Verse,

chain—Ibn Hi sham (2/269-270).
134 See: Hadhal-Habib Ya Muhibb, pp. 189-194, where Shaykh Jaza iri men¬
tioned the stand taken by some towards others.
135 Surat Al 'Imran: 159. This Verse was revealed shortly after the battle of Uhud.
136 Surat Ash-Shura: 38. This is a Makkan Verse which declared consultation
as one of the characteristics of the Faithful.

426

The Prophet of Islam

As for the Prophetic example, we have several instances. One of
them was before the battle of Uhud when he consulted his men
whether they should fight from within the city or go out and face it in
the open. Also, he consulted the Companions over whether he should
make peace with some of the raiding parties at the time of Khandaq
by offering them a third of Madinan crop. We have Abu Hurayrah's
statement who said, "I have not seen a people who consulted each
other more than the Companions of the Prophet Sij."13/
As for the four rightly-guided caliphs, we have on record
'Umar's words. He said addressing the consultative council, "If
someone invited to his own leadership or to that of another, without
having first consulted the Muslims, then the best thing for you is to
kill him." He also said, "Whoever swore allegiance to a leader
without first consulting the Muslims, has no allegiance that he is
bound to, nor is there anything for that leader to claim."138
4.

Legality of duels by the permission of the commander.139

5.

Equality between an ordinary soldier and the commander, both
in war as well as in peace. This was made clear by the incident
involving Sawad and the Prophet i|, when the Prophet m
bared his stomach for Sawad to retaliate. The four rightlyguided caliphs also practiced this during their reign.

6.

The permissibility of taking ransom from the prisoners or to free
them without cost.

7.

It is allowed to kill a prisoner before he is officially handed over
to the commander as Bilal and the Ansar did with Umaiyah bin
Khalaf, killing Ibn 'Awf's prisoner.

1 ’7 Tirmidhi: The Swum (5/375/H. 1767/Tuhfatul-Ahzvadhi). The chain has
been suspected but its text is almost a unanimously accepted statement of
the Prophet ;§§.
ns These reports were mentioned by Abdur-Razzaq: Al-Musannaf (5/445, and
the pages that follow, through a reliable chain. The redactor pointed that
Bukhari had traced reports concerning the stoning to death of the
pregnant through two chains.
139 See the details of this in Al-Mughni of Ibn Qudamah (8/367 and the pages
that follow).

427

The Battle of Badr

8.

Lawfulness of the spoils of war. They are to be distributed only
after a fifth has been set aside for Allah and His Messenger.

9.

Whoever killed a man gets his victim's equipment, but on
condition that the slain should have been one of the fighters and
not of those whose killing the Prophet

has prohibited such as,

women, children, old men, etc. Another condition is that the slain
should have been specifically targeted and fought. In contrast, if
someone shoots an ^rrow at the enemy but someone else is struck,
his equipment will not he the share of the shooter alone.140
10. The treatment of the prisoners leads us to believe that the
Prophet sg| used his own discretion in certain affairs. The
majority of scholars who have believed in this have relied on
this incident as evidence. Further, if it is allowed that the
Prophet

could

use

his

discretion

to

decide

between

alternatives, it has also to be allowed that he could commit an
error, except that he wasn't allowed to continue in his error, if it
occurred. Allah (3£) corrected the Prophet jjjjl immediately.
When such things happened, a Quranic Verse came down, and
if it didn't, it meant Allah's Will coincided with the Prophet's.
11. The fundamental rule about wars is that the Muslims should
prepare themselves fully. Allah (if) said, "And prepare yourselves
for them, so far as possible, with force and steeds of war..." It is
another thing that Allah will help His forces with victory, if they
deserved it as in the case of Badr where angels came down for
help, or Allah sent sleep over the fighters to renew their vigor as
well as He sent rain for relief.
12. Allah

warned the believers that their love of wealth should

play no role in their religious decisions, no matter what their
economic condition was. Accordingly, Allah chided them over
their opinion concerning the spoils of war and their decision
about the prisoners which was influenced by their extreme
condition of want. He said,

140 See the details of this in the same reference, pp. 387-391, chapter 8.

"They ask you about the spoils of war. Say, 'Spoils of war are for

He also said,

"It was not for the Prophet that he should have captives"... until
... "you wish for the gains of this world whereas Allah wishes for

the Hereafter."142, 143
13. On the Day of judgement, the people of Badr would be the
forgiven ones. As for this world, they were to be punished if
they committed a crime, such as it happened in case of
Qudamah bin Maz'un who was punished for drinking wine.
14. It is a Prophetic practice to stay at the place of victory for three
days after the battle.
15. It is Sunnah to bury the martyrs at the place of their fall. As it
happened with the martyrs of Badr and Uhud. And it is not
necessary that the burial prayer be performed as it was not done
at Uhud. As for the martyrs of Badr, it is not known if the
Prophet 3|| performed their burial prayer or not.144
16. A few true heroes emerged at Badr. One of them was Abu

Ibn Ishaq has reported Abu 'Aziz bin 'Umayr: "My brother

taking me captive. He said, "Secure him well. His mother is a rich
woman. She might ransom him from you." Ibn Hisham adds that
when Mus'ab bin 'Umayr said that to Abu Yasar, the captor of his
brother, Abu 'Aziz protested, "My brother. Is this your recommen¬
dation about me?" Mus'ab answered, "He (the captor) is my brother
and not you."147

145 Surat Al-Mujadilah: 22.
146 Reported by Tabarani with a good chain coming from 'Abdullah bin

Ibn Hajar has said in his Talkhisul-Habir (4/113) that Hakim and Bayhaqi
recorded it as a Suspended (Mu allaq) report through Abdullah bin
Shawdhab. So did Uasa'i in Sunan Al-Kubra (9/127) remarking that this is
a Suspended (Mu'allaq) report. Ibn 'Asakir also used it in his Tarikh
(Tahdhib Tarikh Dimashq Al-Kabir, 7/161, ed. 'Abdul-Qadir Badran, Dar AlSirah), without any remark. At the end of the discussion he said,
"Mufaddal bin Ghassan has said that Waqidi rejected the claim that Abu
'Ubaydah made into Islam, as well as rejected the opinion of the Syrian
scholars that Abu 'Ubaydah met his father in the battle and killed him."
He added, "I asked men from the Banu Fihr, one of them being Zufar bin
Muhammad, and others and he answered that his father died before the
advent of Islam." The story was also recorded by Hakim in his AlMustadrak (3/265) who remained silent over its status, as did Dhahabi.
147 ibn Hisham (2/349), and Ibn Ishaq's chain is Interrupted (Munqati'). Ibn

Events and Expeditions
between Badr and Uhud

The Affair of ‘Asma’ bint Marwan
'Asma' was one of those who used to insult the Prophet Hj,
revile Islam and provoke people to violence. She also produced
some satire. When those poetical pieces reached the Prophet #1, he
said, "Will not someone take care of this woman for my sake?"
'Umayr bin 'Adi Khatmi, who was of the same tribe as her husband,
visited her at night in her house. She had her children around her,
one of whom she was suckling. He took her by her hand, released
the child-because 'Umayr was blind-and then struck her with his
sword. Then he attended the morning prayers with the Prophet $g.
He asked him, "Did you kill Marwan's daughter?" He replied,
"Yes." The Prophet

said, "You have helped Allah and His

Messenger, O 'Umayr."1 'Umayr asked, "Is there any penalty on me
for this?" The Prophet #| replied, "Two goats will not lock horns
over this affair."2 The Prophet Sg was the first to use such a phrase.

1

Reported by Ibn Ishaq -Ibn Hisham (4/379), through a chain about which
he did not mention clearly whether he himself heard. It is part of a report
narrated in connection with the death of 'Asma', and so is weak. However
it obtains strength from the trustworthy narrative in Abu Dawud as in the
following footnote.

Subsequently the Prophet i§ named 'Umayr as Basir (the seeing).
This incident took place on the 25th of Ramadan, nineteen months
after Hijrah, almost immediately after the battle of Badr.
Moved by the power of Islam, several of the Banu Khatmah
embraced Islam, and several of those who had until then concealed
their faith, pronounced it openly.

The Prophet’s Expedition to Banu Sulaym and
Ghatafan at Kudr
It wasn't but seven days at Madinah that the Prophet

started

off for Banu Sulaym. That was in Shawwal of the second year after

Hijrah. He reached their waters: the place known as Kudr. He stayed
there for three days before returning, without a fight.* * 3 4 The reason
for the journey to this place was that he had learnt that a group of
people from Sulaym and Ghatafan were planning to attack the
Muslims.

Attempt to assassinate the Prophet #|5
One day 'Umayr bin Wahb and Safwan bin Umaiyah spoke
between themselves about what had befallen them at Badr. 'Umayr

a chain other than that of Ibn Ishaq through a chain that is Connected and
its transmitters reliable as ruled Ibn Hajar in Bulugh Al-Maram (2/241).
Nasa'i has also collected this report in his Sunan (7/107-108) as well as
Tabarani in his Kabir.

See the story as reported in books of campaigns, such as of Ibn Ishaq:
who did not clearly mention hearing the report himself—Ibn Hi sham (4/
377-379) who states that her killing took place after the killing of Abu
'Afak. See also Al-Waqidi (1/172) and Ibn Sa'd (2/27) without a chain.

4

Reported by Ibn Ishaq without a chain — Ibn Hisham (3/64); Al-Waqidi (1/
182-183); Ibn Sa'd (2/131) without a chain. Most probably it is a narrative
of his teacher Waqidi. Waqidi has it as Qararatul-Kudr. Ibn Sa'd said,
"This is the campaign in which Yasar was taken prisoner. He fell in the
share of the Prophet |j§. He found him praying and so freed him.

The story of this conspiracy was mentioned by Ibn Ishaq through a
Disconnected (Mursal) chain — Ibn Hisham (2/371-374). Ibn Hajar said in
Al-Isabah (3/37): "Narrated by Musa bin 'Uqbah in his Maghazi, and

told Safwan that if not for debts on him and the fear that his family
will suffer wants after him, he would have taken a ride to Madinah
and killed Muhammad. Safwan jumped on the chance. He promised
to pay up his debts and consider his family as his by looking after
them if he killed Muhammad or something ill happened to him. The
agreement was kept secret.
When 'Umayr arrived at Madinah, 'Umar 4> felt suspicious. He
took him to the Prophet jgg. The Prophet

asked him to give the

true reason of his visit. He swore he had come to seek the release of
his son Wahb. When he insisted on his version, the Prophet j|| told
him the truth of the story. He told him of the agreement between
him and Safwan at Makkah. 'Umayr was amazed. He embraced
Islam there and then. The Prophet

handed him over to his

Companions and asked them to instruct him in Islam. He also
ordered them to release his son.
The Prophet s§i allowed him to return to Makkah to invite
others to Islam with the same conviction with which he used to
invite to disbelief. It is said that quite a few embraced Islam
following 'Umayr's efforts.

Abu ‘Afak’s Affair
When the Prophet

ordered Harith bin Suwayd bin Thabit be

killed, Abu 'Afak's hypocrisy came to light. He was one of the 'Amr
bin Awf tribe. He said some poetical pieces in favor of Harith bin
Suwayd whom the Prophet

had ordered killed. The Prophet

said, "Who will take care of this dirty man for me?" Salim bin
'Umayr went out and killed the man. That was in Shawwal, twenty
months after Hijrah * * * * * 6

Aswad through 'Urwah through a Disconnected (Mursal) chain, as also
Ibn Mandah, through a Connected (Muttasil) chain who said, 'An
Unfamiliar (Gliarib) reportyWe do not know this report through Ibn 'Imran
except by this chain.' Tabarani said: 'We know it only through Anas bin
Malik.'" And the narration of Aswad and Ibn 'Uqbah is in Dala'il AnNubuwwah by Bayhaqi (3/147-149).

The Expedition to Banu Qaynuqa‘

(a) The Date
Most of the biographers and historians have said that this
expedition took place after the battle of Badr. Ibn Hajar7 prefers this
opinion depending upon the report of Ibn 'Abbas in Abu Dawud.
He evaluated the report as Good (Hasan) and sought strength in
another report of 'Ubadah bin Walid as found in Ibn Ishaq. Zuhn
further said that it took place in Shawwal of the second year after

Hijrah. Waqidi* 11 and Ibn Sad12 have even fixed the day as Saturday,
the middle of Shawwal.

(b) Reasons
Biographical works say that the following were the reasons:
First, when the Muslims emerged victorious at Badr, the Jews of
Banu Qaynuqa' could not conceal their hatred and enmity of Islam
and Muslims. This became evident from their attitude towards the
Prophet m when he gathered them in the market place. He told
them there, "O the Jewish people. Embrace Islam before you are
struck by what struck the Quraysh at Badr." They replied,
"Muhammad. Don't be encouraged by the fact that you killed a
bunch of Quraysh who didn't know how to fight. If you happen to
meet with us in the battle-field, you'll know that we are men, and
that you haven't encountered people like us." Allah

revealed.

at Iris victory at Badr; and also Ibn Sa'd (2/28) without a chain.

narrations but they strengthen each other raising it to the level of Hasan li
Ghayrihi as said Dr. Sindi: Marwiyyat Tarikhi Yahudil-Madinah, fi 'AhdinNubuwzvah, p. 83.

"Say to those who have disbelieved that you will be overcome and

then driven to Hell-fire; an evil resting-place. There is a sign for
you in the two groups that clashed. One group fighting in the
way of Allah and the other, disbelieving, seeing them twice
themselves (in numbers). Allah helps with His succor whomso¬
ever He wills. Surely, in this is a lesson for a people of sight."13
A second reason was that when a Muslim lady visited their
markets, one of the shopkeepers tied her garment to a peg without
her knowledge. As she got up her legs were bared. She cried for
help. One of the Muslims killed the Jew. Other shopkeepers attacked
and killed the Muslim. Muslims began to call the help of other
Muslims. That led to a confrontation between them and the Banu
Qaynuqa'.14
Even if we accept Ibn Hajar's evaluation of Ibn Ishaq's report as
acceptable, as stated under the first reason of Banu Qaynuqa's
deportation, it doesn't mean that they were expelled because they
refused to embrace Islam. Rather, during this period, Islam was
comfortably co-existing with various communities around. The

13 Sunan Abu Dawud (3/402/H. 3001) through a chain in which falls
Muhammad bin Abu Muhammad, the freed-slave of Zayd bin Thabit,
about whom Ibn Hajar thought in his At-Taqrib that he is unknown, p.
505. Despite this he declared it Hasan in Al-Fath (15/204) as did Dhahabi
in At-Tafsir wal-Mufassirun (1/79). Sindi's study suggests that the narra¬
tions in this connection strengthen each other to raise them to a level of
acceptance. (Marwiyyat T-drikhi Yahudil-Madinah, fi 'Ahdin-Nubuwwah, p.
77). Also see: Surat Al 'Imran: 12-13.
14 Ibn Hisham (3/70) through an unreliable chain for it stops at Abu 'Awn
who was a Follower (Tdbi'i) of young age. Further, the chain is also broken
between Ibn Hisham and 'Abdullah bin Ja'far. See Sindi, p. 79, and 'Umari:
Al-Mujtama' Al-Madni, p. 137, and Albani, Difa', pp. 26-27.

The Prophet of Islam

436

Madinan document had already given the Jews the right to practice
their religion. The reasons for their deportation have to be looked
into their continued hostility towards Islam and Muslims. That led
to a lack of security in Madinah as is evidenced by what they did to
the Muslim lady.15
Another reason was the machinations of Shas bin Qays of the
Banu Qaynuqa'. He passed by a group of Aws and Khazraj Muslims
chatting together. The sight of them sitting together as a closely
knitted group filled him with envy. He had witnessed the hatred
that prevailed among them in the pre-Islamic times. He couldn't sit
quiet for long. He asked a Jewish young man to join them in thencompany and speak of the Bu'ath battle, and what had led to the
hostilities. He also instructed him to recite some poetry in favor of
one or the other group to provoke them and remind them of those
that were killed in that battle. Aws had emerged victorious over the
Khazraj in that battle. Aws were then led by Hudhayr bin Simak
Ashhali (Abu Usayd bin Hudhayr) and Khazraj by 'Amr bin
Nu'man Bayadi and both were killed in that battle.
The above is Ibn Ishaq's version. Ibn Hisham also has a
narration without naming the transmitter. Tabari has reported three
versions of this, two of them weak, and a third Good [Mnsun).

(c) Siege and Deportation
The account of Banu Qaynuqa's exile has been preserved in the

Sahih16 works of Ahadith. As for details, they are found in the works
of Ibn Ishaq,17 Waqidi,18 Ibn Sa'd19 and historians who followed
them.
Details tell us that Banu Qaynuqa' were allies of 'Abdullah bin
Ubaiy bin Salul and had proved themselves the most courageous of

the Jews. When their enmity became apparent, the Prophet #§ feared
treachery on their part. So, he returned to them their pledge of peace
following Allah's commandments for such a situation. It said,

"If you fear treachery on part of a people, f/zen throw back their
covenant to them in parity. Surely, Allah does not approve of the
treacherous."20
The Prophet ^ laid siege to their forts which lasted fifteen days.
When things became difficult for them, they came down on the
Prophet's judgement, and that they shall keep their wealth, women
and children. So he ordered that they be tied up. At that moment
'Abdullah bin Ubaiy appeared on the scene and began to plead for
them saying, “Four hundred unarmored and three hundred
armored, who defended me against whites and blacks! Will you
make a game of them in half a day?" The Prophet j§| told him, “You
can have them/'"1 and ordered that they be deported from
Madinah. He made 'Ubadah bin Samit in charge of the affair of
their departure. They went away to Adhri'at (a place in Sham).
Their properties were given to the charge of Muhammad bin
Maslamah. And, after a fifth was removed for the Prophet m, they
were distributed among the Companions.22
It is noteworthy that their ally 'Ubadah bin Samit had disowned
them when they confronted the Prophet sg§. It was about him and
'Abdullah bin Ubaiy that the following Verse was revealed.

20 Surat Al-Anfal: 58.
21 Ibn Ishaq — Ibn Hisham (3/70-71) reported it through an Interrupted
(Munqati') chain; Al-Waqidi (177-178), and Ibn Sa'd (2/92) without a chain
but having the Verse. Ibn Salul's attachment to the Banu Qaynuqa' has
been mentioned in two reports of Ibn Ishaq, but both weak, for both stop
at 'Asim and 'Ubadah. Nevertheless, each of them strengthens the other to
go up to the Hasan li Ghayrihi status. Further, the fact that they are
mentioned by the biographers and war chroniclers, adds on to the
strength. This Sindi said, p. 96.

“O believers. Do not take the Jews and Christians as your bosom
friends. They are true friends unto each other.

Lessons and Rules

1.

The incident laid bare the Jews' hatred of Islam and their habit
of stabbing at the back whenever they got the chance.

2.

During this incident, when he pleaded as he did, as well as on
many other occasions, 'Abdullah bin Ubaiy s evil role came to
light. He was always there to cause trouble, spread mischief,
publish rumors and create dissension among the Muslims.
These were clear signs of his hypocrisy. Nevertheless, the
Prophet #1 always dealt with him as if he was a Muslim. The
scholars therefore have deducted the rule that for all practical
purposes hypocrites should be treated as Muslims leaving their
secrets to Allah Who will deal with them suitably on the Day of
Judgement. Another evidence is Umars words.

There were

people who were criticized by the revelation during the
Prophet's time. The revelation has now stopped. We shall
now deal with them according to what we observe of them.
Whosoever proves that there is good in him, we shall bring him
closer to ourselves. As for his secrets, we do not go after them.
Allah will take account of their secrets. As for him who evinced
evil, we shall not trust him and not believe him, even if he says
that his intentions were good.''24
23 Surat Al-Maidah: 51-52. The story was reported by Ibn Ishaq through a
Disconnected (Mursal) chain-Ibn Hishdm (3/71-72) that is strengthened by
supporting evidences, e.g., Ibn Jarir's report in his Tafsir (6/275) through a
weak chain for there falls in it 'Atiyyah bin Sa'd who dropped the name
of the Companion before him and would not declare whom he heard
from. Or, Ibn Marduwayh in his Tafsir, narrating through 'Ubadah bin
Walid and he through his father, and he through his grandfather 'Ubadah,
where it is stated that it was revealed with reference to him. This is stated
in Suyuti's Ad-Durrul-Manthur (2/291).
24 Al-Bukhdri/Al-Fath (11/67-68/H. 2641).

Events and Expeditions between Badr and Uhud

439

And the wisdom in dealing with the hypocrites at face value,
and, according to their claims, is that people in general should be
prevented from playing with the rules and with other people's lives,
especially, if room is allowed. The rulers of all times will accuse
those they dislike of hypocrisy, and persecute innocent people.25
3.

Very close friendship with the non-Muslims is not allowed.
Rather, they should be disowned, unless the Muslims are too weak
on their own, and are forced to take them as allies. Allah (fg) said,

"Believers do not take the disbelievers as bosom friends apart
from believers. Whoever did that, is on nothing from Allah,
except when taking precaution against them in prudence."26

Sawiq Expedition
On the fifth of Dhul-Hijjah, twenty-two months after Hijrah,
Abu Sufyan came close to the outskirts of Madinah leading two
hundred horsemen. He sought the help of Banu Nadir. Then he
came down from the 'Uraid side - a Madinan valley along the
Harrah mountains — and, after killing two persons and burning
some date-palm trees, retreated hastily. When the Muslims came to
know about what had happened, they rushed out in chase going up
to Qarqaratul-Kudr but could not lay their hands on him. On the
way they picked up lots of sacks filled with flour (Sawiq in Arabic)
that Abu Sufyan's party had relieved themselves of in order to
decrease their weight. When they returned along with the Prophet
they asked him, "Do you think this will be counted as an
expedition in the way of Allah?" He said yes and it was named
"Expedition of the Flour (Ghazwatus-Sawiq)."27

2' See Buti: Fiqhus-Sirah, pp. 182-183.
2fi Surat At 'Imran: 28. See the details of this case story in Al-Wala' wal-Bara'
fil-Islam by Muhammad bin Sa'eed Qahtani.

Qarqaratul-Kudr Expedition
The Prophet #§ went out with two hundred men in the middle
of Muharram, twenty-three months after Hijrah. He was prompted
by the news that Banu Sulaym, Ghatfan and some other tribes were
gathering themselves at Qarqaratul-Kudr. This was a watering place
under the control of Banu Sulaym. Muslims were their target. When
the Prophet m, advanced towards them, they dispersed, leaving
their cattle behind as easy booty.
A young boy called Yasar was also caught along with the cattle.
The Muslims placed him in the Prophet's share who promptly
released him.

Ka‘b bin Ashrafs Execution
Ka'b originally belonged to Banu Nabhan. They were a family
from Tay'. His father had committed a murder and had sought
refuge in Madinah where he allied himself with Banu Nadir and
married 'Aqilah bint Abu Huqaiq. She gave birth to Ka'b.2s
Ka'b was a poet. Muslim victory at Badr angered him. He
traveled to Makkah to incite the Quraysh to revenge. He also wrote
satires ridiculing the Prophet j||. When Abu Sufyan asked him, "I
abjure you in the Name of Allah, is our religion better in the sight of
God or that of Muhammad?" He replied, "You are better guided
than him." Allah ($g) revealed.

Disconnected (Mursal). Tabari also recorded in his Tarikh (2/484) taking it
from Ibn Ishaq through the same chain. However he recorded it as
'Abdullah bin Ka'b in place of 'Abdullah — Al-Waqidi (1/181); Ibn Sa'd (2/
30-31) without a chain and Ibn Kathir in Al-Bidayah (3/378) who however
maintains that it was the Qarqaratul-Kudr campaign.
28 See Ibn Hajar/AZ-Fut/i (5/209/Maghdzi, ch. Qatl Ka'b bin Ashraf). See also
Ibn Ishaq through a Mursal chain -Ibn Hishdm (3/74-75); and Tabari in
Tarikh (2/488).

"Have you seen a people that were given a portion of the Book?
They believe in magic and Satan and say to the disbelievers,
'These are better guided than the believers.'"29
Upon his return to Makkah he began to produce indecent
poetry against some Muslim women. The Prophet «j§; declared his
blood lawful.

Muhammad bin Maslamah and Abu Na'ilah

volunteered to finish him off. Abu Na'ilah was Ka'b's foster
brother. Ibn Maslamah laid a perfect plan for the operation. The
Prophet ^ allowed them to say to the Jew what would not evoke his
suspicion and that was to denounce him (the Prophet #§) in his
presence. When Ka'b showed up (as they went to his place) Abu
Na'ilah asked him to lend some dates in order to pay up to the
Prophet j||. While saying that, he spoke ill of the Prophet #§ and
what difficulties he had brought on them. Ka'b demanded that they
mortgage their women or children. Ibn Maslamah politely turned
down Ka'b's demand, for it would bring on him shame. He
proposed that he would mortgage his weapon.
Ka'b agreed. So, at night Ibn Maslamah went up to Ka'b's fort
along with Abu Na'ilah. His name was Yalkan bin Salamah bin
Waqsh.' Abbad bin Bishr, Harith bin Bishr and Abu 'Abs bin Jabr of
the Aws were with them. They called out and he came down
although his wife tried to prevent him from answering a call in that
part of the night. Abu Na'ilah walked about a little with him. One of
them pretended to smell his hair and grabbed him therewith.
Another struck him and they succeeded in killing him. In the
confusion, one of them was injured by his companion's sword.30
The man who struck him was Harith bin Aws bin Mu'adh as in a
trustworthy report of Ibn Ishaq.

29 Surat An-Nisa': 51.
30 This is the summary of what Bukhari had to report Al-Fath (15/210/H.
4037); Muslim (3/1425-1426/H. 1801). The story was also reported by Abu
Dawud in his Sunan (3/211-212/The Book of Jihad) and in Dala'il by
Bayhaqi (3/187-200) with different attributions and from different sources;
Ibn Sa'd (2/32-34) and Al-Waqidi (1/184-193). Ibn Ishaq reported the first
part of the story with a Mursal chain—Ibn Hisham (3/79) and (3/81-84).
There are some differences between the two version of the Sahihayn and

The Prophet of Islam

442

When the Jews protested the killing, the Prophet ^ reminded
them about what Ka'b had been saying and doing. Nevertheless, the
action drove fear into the Jews and other pagans around. So the
Prophet m offered them renewal of the peace treaty. He wrote down
one covering everyone around, as recorded by Abu Dawud.31 This
was in line with an earlier treaty that had been penned down before
the battle of Badr. It is known as the Madinan Document.32
Ka'b was killed after Badr and before the Banu Nadir33
expedition. Waqidi34 has said that it took place in the third month,
fourteenth of Rabi'ul-Awwal, twenty-five months after Hijrah.

Lessons

1.

Ka'b's assassination makes it allowable to kill one of the enemy
by deception because of his treachery or untrustworthiness.

2.

Permissibility of telling lies to the enemies and playing tricks on
them, for war is a deception.

3.

In the killing of a treacherous person is a lesson to others who
are discouraged from following his footsteps.

that of the biographers and war chroniclers but the texts are same. See
details in Ibn Hajar explaining the incident of the killing of Ka'b bin
Ashraf.
31 Sunan Abu Dawud (3/402-403) who depends on the report of the father of
'Abdur-Rahman bin 'Abdullah bin Ka'b. Now, if the narrator meant his
grandfather by citing his father, it could be considered Connected
(Muttasil) whose transmitters are reliable. But, if he meant his father
'Abdullah, then it is Mursal, needing supporting evidences to rise up to
the Hasan li Ghayrihi status. Nonetheless, such supporting evidence is
found in Haythami's Majma' (6/195-196) who quotes through 'Abdullah
bin Ka'b from his uncle in words similar to those of Ahmad. He declared
the transmitters as reliable. The Hadith has other supporting evidences
such as one reported by Bayhaqi in his Dalail (3/196-197) through two
chains. These are the supporting evidences that allow the Hadith to be
used for scholarly purposes as said Sindi, p. 108.
32 Dr. 'Umari: Al-Mujtama' Al-Madni, p. 142.

Events and Expeditions between Badr and Uliud

443

Expedition to Dhi Amr
The Prophet

received news that the Ghatafan tribe had

gathered in a place called Dhi Amr in Najd. He went out to them.
But when they learnt that he was advancing towards them, they
dispersed.35 Waqidi36 and Ibn Sa'd37 have said that those who had
gathered at the waters of Dhi Amr were of the Ghatafan: precisely of
the Banu ThaTabah bin Muharib. Muslims were four hundred and
fifty men. They had gone out on the 12th of Rabi'ul-Awwal in the
third year after Hijrah' Waqidi38 has said that the day was a
Thursday.
Waqidi and Ibn Sa'd have also mentioned that the incident
involving Da'thur Muharibi took place during this expedition. The
story goes that rain fell on the Muslims during their return journey.
The Prophet's clothes got wet. He moved out to the outer flank of
the valley to remove and dry his clothes. Then he lied down under a
tree. His enemies were watching him. They instigated their chieftain
Da'thur to assassinate the Prophet ig. He advanced with his bare
sword, stood on the head of the Prophet ^ and asked, "Who can
save you from me now?" The Prophet ^ replied, "Allah." And
Jibril pushed him down so that his sword fell off his hand. The
Prophet #| picked it up, held it against him and asked, "Who will
save you from me now?" The man said, "No one." The Prophet jig
spared him. He became a Muslim, returned to his people and began
to invite them to Islam. Allah (M) sent down the Verses,

"O believers. Remember Allah's blessings on you when a people
intended to stretch their hands at you, then He withheld their
hands from you.”39

The Buhran Expedition
The Prophet ^ went out with three hundred men chasing a
Quraysh caravan as mentioned by Ibn Ishaq 40 Waqidi41 said that he
had intended the Banu Sulaym. He went up to Buhran from the
Furu' side on the main trade route between Makkah and Sham. No
fighting took place.
That was in Jumada Al-Ula, twenty-seven months after Hijrah,
it

as Waqidi and his disciple Ibn Sa'd have stated.

The Qaradah Expedition
After Badr, the Quraysh were fearful of using the common
trade route to Sham. They decided on a new route that went via
Iraq. Accordingly, Abu Sufyan went out at the head of a caravan
consisting of a large number of Makkan traders heading for Sham.
It is said that they were carrying a large amount of silver with
them. They hired a man from Bakr bin Wa'il called Furat bin
Haiyan as a guide. When the Prophet

got the news he

dispatched Zayd bin Harithah in their chase. He caught up with
them at the waters of Najd known as Qaradah. He was able to lay
his hands on the silver, but the men escaped. That was six months
after the battle of Badr43 being in Jumada Ath-Thaniyah, twentyseven months after Hijrah.44

The story of Du'thur is confirmed by the Saliihayn although without this
context and in connection with a campaign other than this, and that he
did not accept Islam. What is agreed upon between the biographers and
the Sahihayn is that Allah protected the Prophet jgj from him. Obviously,
what is in the Sahih is more correct. This story will come later in a
narration by Bukhari, Muslim, and Ibn Ishaq, while discussing the DhaturRiqa' campaign.
40 Ibn Hisham (3/68) without a chain, so it is weak.

44 Al-Waqidi (1/197), and Ibn Sa'd (2/36) whose chain is weak.

Events and Expeditions between Badr and Uhud

445

Ibn Sa'd45 has stated that there were a hundred men in this
expedition, and that the silver weighed about 30,000 dirham, worth
about a hundred thousand.
When the Quraysh could not break the economic siege, they felt
the need to urgently address the problem and attack Madinah. They
badly needed to open the routes and regain their prestige. These
factors led to the raid on Madinah and the battle at Uhud.
